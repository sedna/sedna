                            Sedna XML Database
                        Changes Log & Release Notes

=============================================================================
Release 3.5
Release date: 2011-11-28
=============================================================================

   - Native implementation of full-text indices. Now dtSearch is not
     necessary to create and query full-text indices. For details refer to
	 the Sedna Programmer's Guide, Managing Full-Text Indices section.
   - CDATA section formatting is now saved for text nodes in direct element
     constructors and can be saved during bulk load using special option:

		 declare option se:bulk-load "cdata-section-preserve=yes";

	 (see Sedna Programmer's Guide, section Bulk Load for further details)
   - XQuery serialization output option 'cdata-section-elements' is now
     supported. It specifies list of elements names. Content of these
	 elementsis serialized wrapped in CDATA.
   - New 'listen-address' Sedna server option. This option specifies an
     address that Sedna server will accept clients connections on. It can be
	 specified as IP numeric value or host name.

     NOTE: the default value for this option is localhost and it makes Sedna
     operate NOT in the same way it did before. Check Administration Guide,
     section 2.2.1 "Running Sedna", -listen-address option description for
     details. To make Sedna behave as previous releases (not recommended)
     specify 0.0.0.0.

   - Bug fixes, small improvements and performance optimizations. Including
     completely rewritten 'distinct-values' XQuery function.

   Important note:

   Databases created with previous versions of Sedna will not work properly
   with Sedna 3.5. Please, use Sedna import/export utility to migrate your
   data to Sedna 3.5 (see Sedna Administration Guide, section 2.5).

=============================================================================
Release 3.4
Release date: 2010-09-24
=============================================================================

   - 64-bit native support: 64-bit binaries are now available for all
     supported platforms.
   - CMake cross-platform, open-source build system is now used to build
     Sedna on all supported platforms (e.g. Visual Studio project can be
	 generated on Windows). See INSTALL file for details on configuration
	 and installation process.
   - libedit support on FreeBSD: Sedna Terminal (se_term) on FreeBSD is now
     enhanced with auto-completion, history and advanced editing facilities.
   - Storage Manager IO optimization: significant increase of bulk load
     speed and other IO bound updates and queries.
   - Internal data representation optimization: database now takes less hard
     disk space.
   - Reduced log mode (LOG_LESS_MODE) behaviour changed: transaction enters
     exclusive mode (there are no other concurrent transactions possible)
	 when log-less mode is turned on. For details refer to the Programmer's
	 Guide, C API LOG_LESS_MODE connection option description.
   - Sedna C library naming scheme changed on Unix-like platforms. There are
     three versions of library are available now: libsedna.so (dynamic),
	 libsedna.a (static), libsedna_pic.a (static with PIC enabled).
   - System document $modules returned. It can be used to list names of all
     available modules.
   - Linux kernel 2.4 support dropped.
   - Bug fixes, small improvements and optimizations.

   Important note:

   Databases created with previous versions of Sedna will not work properly
   with Sedna 3.4. Please, use Sedna import/export utility to migrate your
   data to Sedna 3.4 (see Sedna Administration Guide, section 2.5).

=============================================================================
Release 3.3
Release date: 2010-04-10
=============================================================================

   - XQuery execution errors details significantly improved: Sedna reports
     the location of runtime errors with both line and column number.
   - Query Explain Statement - shows query execution plan of the query or
     update statement.
   - Query Profile Statement - executes query and shows profile information
     for each operation in the query execution plan.
   - Sedna Client/Server Protocol version 4: each returned item now has
     XQuery Data Model type.
   - Metadata system document '$modules' removed. Use collection '$modules'
     instead to get names of all modules.
   - Bug fixes, improvements like improved internal representation,
     completely C/C++ source code.

   Important note:

   Databases created with previous versions of Sedna will not work properly
   with Sedna 3.3. Please, use Sedna import/export utility to migrate your
   data to Sedna 3.3 (see Sedna Administration Guide, section 2.5).

=============================================================================
Release 3.2
Release date: 2009-06-30
=============================================================================

   - Sedna Terminal has been significantly improved:

       * Tab-completion for commands and queries (Linux, Mac OS, Solaris).
       * Aliases for frequently used commands (e.g. \q instead of \quit).
         For details type \set? in terminal.
       * There is history now in Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, which is saved in
         terminal user's home directory.

   - SEDNA_LOG_AMMOUNT option for driver and corresponding \LOG_LESS_MODE
     for terminal. These options allow severely reduced logical log size
     during bulk-loads at the expense of longer commits.
   - Added new option to stop Sedna. Use "se_stop -hard" command to rollback
     all running transactions immediately.
   - Full Support for Solaris (x86) operating system.
   - Keep Alive Timeout option. It specifies number of seconds session waits
     for the next request from the same client on the same connection.
   - Two new options to tune logical log file size (-log-file-size) and
     count (-max-log-files). This allows more control on recovery and logical
     log size.
   - C API library is now provided in multiple versions under Windows:
     static /MT, static /MD and dynamic.
   - Event Log severity level option. In OLTP-like applications it can be
     turned off to get better performance.
   - se:get-property() function added. Provides a facility to retrieve in
     run-time current values of system parameters.
   - CDB persistent heap options removed
   - Bug fixes, internal improvements like new flex/bison based parser, etc.

   Important note:

   Databases created with previous versions of Sedna will not work properly

         Sedna is now replaced with a new version-based recovery.

=============================================================================
Release 0.1
Release date: 2004-04-12
=============================================================================

   Sedna is a native XML DBMS implemented from scratch in C/C++ and Scheme.
   It is designed having the following main goals in mind:

   1) support for all traditional DBMS features (such as update and query
      languages, query optimization, fine-grain concurrency control, various
      indexing techniques, recovery and security);
   2) efficient support for unlimited volumes of document-centric and
      data-centric XML documents that may have a complex and irregular
      structure;
   3) support for the W3C XQuery language in such a way that the system can
      be efficiently used for solving problems from different domains such as
      XML data querying, XML data transformations and even business logic
      computation (in this case XQuery is regarded as a general-purpose
      functional programming language);

   The first release of Sedna 0.1 is a ready-to-use system that provides the
   following fundamental features:

   - Support for the W3C XQuery language (partial support for the latest
     working drafts of 12 November 2003).
   - Support for a declarative update language (it is based on the XQuery
     update proposal by Patrick Lehti).
   - Native XML data storage structures designed for efficient support for
     XQuery and its data model (no underlying relational or another DBMS).
     The XML data storage is based on descriptive schema (also called
     DataGuide).
   - Administration via easy-to-use command line utilities.
   - Supplied with extensive documentation including Quick Start.

   Sedna is available for free for commercial and non-commercial usage.
