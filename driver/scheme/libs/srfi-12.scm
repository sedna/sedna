;		Implementation of SRFI-12
;
; Most of the generic code and the comments are taken from
;
; SRFI-12: Exception Handling
; By William Clinger, R. Kent Dybvig, Matthew Flatt, and Marc Feeley
; http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-12/

; The SRFI-12 Reference implementation has been amended where needed with
; a platform-specific code
;


;------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Catching exceptions
; The platform-specific part

; Procedure: with-exception-handler HANDLER THUNK 
; Returns the result(s) of invoking thunk. The handler procedure is
; installed as the current exception handler in the dynamic context of
; invoking thunk.

; Procedure: abort OBJ
; Raises a non-continuable exception represented by OBJ.
; The abort procedure does not ensure that its argument is a
; condition. If its argument is a condition, abort does not ensure that
; the condition indicates a non-continuable exception.
 
; Procedure: exc:signal OBJ
; Raises a continuable exception represented by OBJ.
; In SRFI-12, this procedure is named 'signal'. However, this name
; clashes with the name of an internal Bigloo procedure. In a compiled
; code, this clash leads to a Bus error.

; Procedure: current-exception-handler
; Returns the current exception handler.
