   This document describes the installation of Sedna from the source
   code distribution.
     _________________________________________________________________

                               Short Version

   In a terminal type (substitute <install-path> with the path to a directory
   for which you have read/write permissions):

export SEDNA_INSTALL=<install-path>
make
make install

   Note: The operating system user that is going to run Sedna must have 
   r-w-x permissions for the following Sedna directories:

$SEDNA_INSTALL/data
$SEDNA_INSTALL/cfg

   To grant the necessary permisions to the user on Linux 
   you can use the following command (suppose, <sedna-user> is the user 
   that is going to run Sedna):

chown <sedna-user> cfg data

                                Requirements

   Sedna is expected to build and run on the following platforms:
   1. Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003 (and possibly Windows NT)
   2. Linux with kernel version 2.4.xxx and 2.6.xxx

   Note that Sedna will *not* run on Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME.

   A modern POSIX-compatible platform should be able to run Sedna potentially, 
   but some effort should be made.

   The following software packages are required for building Sedna:

     * A Unix console and a set of widely known Unix tools such as rm, mkdir,
       m4, etc are required. They are usually present in any Unix 
       installation. For the Windows platform you need the Cygwin package.
     * GNU make is required; other make programs will *not* work. 
     * You need a C/C++ compiler. For the Windows platform Microsoft C/C++ 
       complier of one of the following versions is required: version 
       12.00.xxxx (Visual C++ 6.0), version 13.00.xxxx (Visual C++ .Net 2002)
       or version 13.10.xxxx (Visual C++ .Net 2003). For Linux GCC version 
       3.x.x is required. GCC is also required for the Windows platform for 
       making dependencies (so it is recommended to use Cygwin package with 
       GCC in it).
     * gzip is needed to unpack the distribution in the first place. If
       you are reading this, you probably already got past that hurdle.
     * For building documentation you need LaTex package. For the Windows platform it is 
       recommended to use GhostScript package version 6.5 or higher (paths to 
       its bin and lib should be in the environment variable PATH).
     * For building Java API driver your need Sun Microsystems JDK version 
       1.4 or higher.
     * The Sedna source code distribution for Windows contains some 
       libraries in the binary form. They are modified PCRE library, Chicken 
       Scheme compiler, Expat XML parser and PCCTS Tools. They are provided 
       in the binary form to simplify building process while they are still 
       available in the source code at the sites of their respective 
       developers. Actually, you need not know about them until you got 
       problems with them or you are going to port Sedna to other platforms.

   Note: We neither support nor plan to support MinGW environment for building
   Sedna on Windows. If you do not have Microsoft Visual C++ consider using
   free building tools from Microsoft: Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 
   together with Microsoft Windows Platform SDK.


   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about 100
   MB for the source tree during compilation and about 10 MB for the
   installation directory. The default size database requires 
   additionally about 250 Mb.
     _________________________________________________________________

                           Installation Procedure

    1. Configuration
       The first step of the installation procedure is to set environment
       variables for building Sedna.

export ACTIVE_CONFIGURATION=Release

       Turns on the release mode. Otherwise (ACTIVE_CONFIGURATION=Debug) 
       executables will contain debug information.

export AUTH_SWITCH=1

       Turns on support for Database users access privileges. Set AUTH_SWITCH 
       to 0 if you would like to turn this feature off (if you are not 
       planning to use this feature we recommend to turn it off).

export ENABLE_TRIGGERS=1

       Turns on support for triggers. Set ENABLE_TRIGGERS to 0 if you would 
       like to turn support for triggers off.

export EL_DEBUG=0

       Throw out all debug printings. Set EL_DEBUG to 1 if you would like
       to get all printings.

export JAVA_DRIVER=1
       
       Compiles Java driver. Set JAVA_DRIVER to 0 if you do not want java 
       driver to be compiled.

export SQL_CONNECTION=1

       Adds support to SQL Connections. Set SQL_CONNECTION to 0 if you do 
       not want SQL Connection to be compiled.

export STATIC_SYS_LIBS=0

       Links Sedna executables with shared system libraries. Set 
       STATIC_SYS_LIBS to 1 if you want to link Sedna executables with
       static system libraries.

export SEDNA_INSTALL=<install-path>

       Identifies the directory where to install Sedna in case of
       "make install" (see below).

    2. Build
       To start the build, type
make
       (Remember to use GNU make) The build may take anywhere from 10
       minutes to half an hour depending on your hardware. The last three
       lines displayed should be
===================================================================
Make done
===================================================================

    3. Installing the Files

make install
       This will install files into the directory identified by 
       $SEDNA_INSTALL that was specified in step 1. Make sure that you have 
       appropriate permissions to write into that area. 

    4. Setting Operating System Environment

       The operating system user that is going to run Sedna must have 
       r-w-x permissions for the following Sedna directories:

$SEDNA_INSTALL/data
$SEDNA_INSTALL/cfg

       To grant the necessary permisions to the user on Linux 
       you can use the following command (suppose, <sedna-user> is the user 
       that is going to run Sedna):

chown <sedna-user> cfg data

   Uninstallation: To undo the installation just delete files installed 
   into $SEDNA_INSTALL/sedna.

   Cleaning: After the installation you can make room by removing the
   built files from the source tree with the command "make clean".

                          Post-Installation Setup

Environment Variables

   You may want to add $SEDNA_INSTALL/sedna/bin to the environment variable 
   PATH. Note, that we recommend you to use absolute path. 

Database Files

   Database files will be placed by default into $SEDNA_INSTALL/sedna.
   You may want to set up the place where database files are stored by modifying
   $SEDNA_INSTALL/sedna/etc/sednaconf.xml.sample. 
   See Sedna Administration Guide for details on how to configure Sedna.
