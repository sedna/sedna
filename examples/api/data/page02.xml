<summary><p><b>Aristotle</b> (<link label="Greek language">Greek</link>: <template head="polytonic"><field>Ἀριστοτέλης</field></template> <i>Aristotélēs</i>) (384 BC – 322 BC) was a <link label="Greeks">Greek</link> <link label="Philosophy">philosopher</link>, a student of <link label="Plato">Plato</link> and teacher of <link label="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</link>.   He wrote on many different subjects, including <link label="Physics">physics</link>, <link label="Metaphysics">metaphysics</link>, <link label="Poetics (Aristotle)">poetry</link>, <link label="Theater">theater</link>, <link label="Logic">logic</link>, <link label="Rhetoric">rhetoric</link>, <link label="Politics">politics</link>, <link label="Government">government</link>, <link label="Ethics">ethics</link>, <link label="Biology">biology</link> and <link label="Zoology">zoology</link>.</p>

<p>Aristotle (together with <link label="Socrates">Socrates</link> and <link label="Plato">Plato</link>) is one of the most important philosophers in Western thought.  He was one of the first to systematize philosophy and science.  His thinking on physics and science had a profound impact on medieval thought, which lasted until the <link label="Renaissance">Renaissance</link>, and the accuracy of some of his biological observations was only confirmed in the last century.  His logical works contain the earliest formal study of <link label="Logic">logic</link> that we have and was not superseded until the late nineteenth century.  In the <link label="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</link>, <link label="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</link> metaphysics had a profound influence on <link label="Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)">philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions</link>, and on Christian thought, where its legacy is still felt in <link label="Christian theology">Christian theology</link>,  for example in <link label="Eastern Orthodox Christian theology">Orthodox theology</link>, and especially within the <link label="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</link> tradition shaped by <link label="Scholasticism">scholasticism</link>.  All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.</p>

<p>Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (<link label="Cicero">Cicero</link> described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost. They were lost and rediscovered several times, and it is believed that about one fifth of the original works have survived.</p>
</summary><section depth="1"><title>Life</title>

<p>Aristotle was born in <link label="Stageira">Stageira</link>, <link label="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</link> in 384 BC. His father was the personal physician to <link label="Amyntas III of Macedon">King Amyntas of Macedon</link>. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the <link label="Aristocracy">aristocracy</link>. At about the age of eighteen, he went to <link label="Athens">Athens</link> to continue his education at <link label="Platonic Academy">Plato's Academy</link>. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years, not leaving until after Plato's death in 347 BC. He then traveled with <link label="Xenocrates">Xenocrates</link> to the court of <link label="Hermias of Atarneus">Hermias of Atarneus</link> in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with <link label="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</link> to the island of <link label="Lesbos Island">Lesbos</link>, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias' daughter (or niece) <link label="Pythias">Pythias</link>. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by <link label="Philip II of Macedon">Philip of Macedon</link> to become tutor to <link label="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</link>. </p>

<p>After spending several years tutoring the young Alexander, Aristotle returned to Athens. By <link label="335 BC">335 BC</link>, he established his own school there, known as the <link label="Lyceum">Lyceum</link>. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died, and Aristotle became involved with <link label="Herpyllis">Herpyllis</link> of <link label="Stageira">Stageira</link>, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, <link label="Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)">Nicomachus</link>. According to the <link label="Suda">Suda</link>, he also had an <link label="Eromenos">eromenos</link>, <link label="Palaephatus">Palaephatus of Abydus</link>.<ref>William George Smith,<i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</i>, vol. 3, <external href="http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html">p. 88</external></ref></p>

<p>It is during this period in Athens when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in <link label="Treatise">treatise</link> form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include  <i><link label="Physics (Aristotle)">Physics</link></i>, <i><link label="Metaphysics (Aristotle)">Metaphysics</link></i>, <i><link label="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</link></i>, <i><link label="Politics (Aristotle)">Politics</link></i>, <i><link label="De Anima">De Anima</link> (On the Soul)</i> and <i><link label="Poetics (Aristotle)">Poetics</link></i>. These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, vary significantly in both style and substance.</p>

<p>Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied <link label="Apples">apples</link>, <link label="Astronomy">astronomy</link>, <link label="Economics">economics</link>, <link label="Embryology">embryology</link>, <link label="Geography">geography</link>, <link label="Geology">geology</link>, <link label="Meteorology">meteorology</link>, <link label="Physics">physics</link> and <link label="Zoology">zoology</link>. In philosophy, he wrote on <link label="Aesthetics">aesthetics</link>, <link label="Ethics">ethics</link>, <link label="Government">government</link>, <link label="Metaphysics">metaphysics</link>, <link label="Politics">politics</link>, <link label="Psychology">psychology</link>, <link label="Rhetoric">rhetoric</link> and <link label="Theology">theology</link>. He also studied <link label="Education">education</link>, foreign customs, <link label="Literature">literature</link> and <link label="Poetry">poetry</link>. His combined works constitute a virtual <link label="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</link> of Greek knowledge.  It has been suggested that Aristotle was likely the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.<ref><template head="cite book"><field name="last">Neill

<p>Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared.  <link label="Eurymedon the hierophant">Eurymedon the hierophant</link> denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor.

<template head="main"><link label="Organon">Organon</link></template>
<p>What we today call <i>Aristotelian logic</i>, Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean <i>dialectics</i>. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
#<i>Categories</i>
#<i>On Interpretation</i>
#<i>Prior Analytics</i>
#<i>Posterior Analytics</i>
#<i>Topics</i>
#<i>On Sophistical Refutations</i></p>

<p>The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the <i>Organon</i>, namely the fourth book of <i>Metaphysics.</i>.<ref>Bocheński, 1951.</ref></p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Modal logic</title>
<p>Aristotle is also the creator of syllogisms with modalities (<link label="Modal logic">modal logic</link>). The word modal refers to the word 'modes', explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of truth. Aristotle introduced the qualification of 'necessary' and 'possible' premises.</p>

<template head="details"><field>Aristotle's theory of universals</field></template>

<p>Aristotle defines his  &quot;idea&quot; referring to the unconditional basis of <link label="Phenomena">phenomena</link>. Both student and master regard philosophy as <link label="Universality (philosophy)">universal</link>; Aristotle, however, found the universal in <link label="Particular">particular</link> things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their <link label="Prototype">prototype</link> or <link label="Exemplar">exemplar</link>. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas. In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both <link label="Inductive reasoning">inductive</link> and <link label="Deductive reasoning">deductive</link>, while Plato's is essentially deductive from <i><link label="A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)">a priori</link></i> principles.<ref><template head="cite book"><field name="last">Jori

<p>In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and included fields that would be regarded today as <link label="Physics">physics</link>, <link label="Biology">biology</link> and other <link label="Natural science">natural science</link>s. In modern times, the scope of <i>philosophy</i> has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the <link label="Scientific method">scientific method</link>. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.</p>

<p>In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with <link label="Reasoning">reasoning</link>, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term <i>science</i> carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;<link label="Scientific method">scientific method</link>&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (<i>dianoia</i>) is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (<i>Metaphysics</i> 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, <link label="Mathematics">mathematics</link> and metaphysics.</p>

<p>If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) <link label="Logic">Logic</link>; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including <link label="Metaphysics">Metaphysics</link>, <link label="Physics">Physics</link>, <link label="Mathematics">Mathematics</link>, (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.</p>

<p>In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle’s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform original research in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences. </p>

<p>Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the sixteenth century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.</p>

<p>His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, but there are some curious errors. For example, in his <i><link label="History of Animals">History of Animals</link></i> he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. In a similar vein, <link label="John Philoponus">John Philoponus</link>, and later <link label="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</link>, showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that the more massive object falls faster than a less massive object is incorrect.<ref><external href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2"> Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</external></ref>  Additionally, Aristotle refuted <link label="Democritus">Democritus</link>'s claim that the <link label="Milky Way">Milky Way</link> was made up of a multitude of stars.<template head="Fact"><field name="date">June 2007</field></template>  He also disputed the claim that the <link label="Stars">stars</link> visible in the night sky were just like the Earth's Sun; he calculated that they would have to be millions of times farther away from the Earth than the Sun, and thus these claims were dismissed for hundreds of years.<template head="Fact"><field name="date">June 2007</field></template></p>

<p>In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched <link label="Reason">reason</link>. Today's <link label="Scientific method">scientific method</link> assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.</p>

<p>Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots, the largest being his inability to see the application of mathematics to physics. Aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own, whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own. In this philosophy, he could not imagine that there was a relationship between them. He also posited a flawed cosmology that we may discern in selections of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, which was widely accepted up until the 1500s. From the 3rd century to the 1500s, the dominant view held that the Earth was the center of the universe (<link label="Geocentrism">geocentrism</link>). This scientific concept, as proposed by Aristotle and Plato was later adopted as dogma by the Roman Catholic Church because it placed mankind at the center of the universe, and scientists who disagreed, such as <link label="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</link>, were considered heretics. This erroneous concept was eventually rejected.</p>

<p>Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.<ref><link label="John Burnet (classicist)">Burent, John.</link> 1928. <i>Platonism</i>, Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103-104.</ref>  However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded (in the West) for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants. This made the study of physics, and all other sciences, respectable. In actuality, however, this observation transcends physics into metaphysics.</p>

<p>Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place; the earth at the centre of the universe, then water, then air, then fire. When they are out of their natural place they have natural motion, requiring no external cause, which is towards that place; so bodies sink in water, air bubbles up, rain falls, flame rises in air. The heavenly element has perpetual circular motion.</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Causality, The Four Causes</title><p>&lt;!-- This section is linked from <link label="Retrocausality">Retrocausality</link>. See <link label="WP:MOS#Section management">WP:MOS#Section management</link> --&gt;
The <link label="Material cause">material cause</link> is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination), a relationship known as the part-whole causation. 
The <link label="Formal cause">formal cause</link> tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation.   
The <link label="Efficient cause">efficient cause</link> is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. The <link label="Final cause">final cause</link> is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behavior.  
Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes.</p>

<p>Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.</p>

<p>All further investigations of causality will consist of imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, such as final &gt; efficient &gt; material &gt; formal (<link label="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</link>), or of restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Chance and spontaneity</title>
<p>Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.</p>

<p>There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Physics</i> 2.6</ref></p>

<p>Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of <link label="Immaterial">immaterial</link> being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of abstraction.&quot;  He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;</p>
<section depth="2"><title>Substance, potentiality and actuality</title>
<p>Aristotle examines the concept of substance (<i><link label="Ousia">ousia</link></i>) in his <i><link label="Metaphysics (Aristotle)">Metaphysics</link></i>, Book VII and he concludes that a particular <b>substance</b> is a combination of both <b>matter</b> and <b>form</b>. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the <link label="Substratum">substratum</link> or the stuff of which it is composed <i>e.g.</i> the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the <i>potential</i> house. While the form of the substance, is the <i>actual</i> house, namely ‘covering for bodies and chattels’ or any other <link label="Genus-differentia definition">differentia</link> (see also <link label="Predicables">predicables</link>). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII 1043a 10-30</ref></p>

<p>With regard to the change (<i>kinesis</i>) and its causes now, as he defines in his <link label="Physics (Aristotle)">Physics</link> and <link label="On Generation and Corruption">On Generation and Corruption</link> 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from 
1. growth and diminution, which is change in quantity 
2. locomotion, which is change in space and 
3. alteration, which is change in quality. 
The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of <link label="Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)">potentiality</link> (<i>dynamis</i>) and <link label="Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)">actuality</link> (<i>entelecheia</i>) in association with the matter and the form.</p>

<p>Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (<i>dynamei</i>) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (<i>poiein</i>) or 'be acted upon' (<i>paschein</i>), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate - being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise - acting). </p>

<p>Actuality is the fulfillment of the <b>end</b> of the potentiality. Because the <b>end</b> (<i>telos</i>) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that actuality is when the seed of the plant becomes a plant. 
 
“ For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.”<ref>Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> IX 1050a 5-10</ref></p>

<p>In conclusion, the <b>matter</b> of the house is its <b>potentiality</b> and the <b>form</b> is its <b>actuality</b>. The <link label="Formal cause">formal cause</link> (<i>aitia</i>) then of that change from potential to actual house, is the <link label="Reason">reason</link> (<i>logos</i>) of the house builder and the <link label="Final cause">final cause</link> is the end, namely the house itself. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. </p>

<p>With this <link label="Definition">definition</link> of the <link label="Particular">particular</link> substance (i.e., <b>matter and form</b>), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, <i>e.g.</i>, what is that makes the man one? Since, according to <link label="Plato">Plato</link> there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII 1045a-b</ref></p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Universals and particulars</title>
<template head="main"><link label="Aristotle's theory of universals">Aristotle's theory of universals</link></template>

<p>Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.</p>

<p>Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. <link label="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</link> is a contemporary philosopher that agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.</p>

<p>Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are &quot;instantiated&quot;. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.</p>

<p>One way for contemporary philosophers to justify this position is by asserting the <link label="Eleatic principle">eleatic principle</link>.</p>

<p>In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.</p>

<p>Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle did his research on natural history on the isle of <link label="Lesbos">Lesbos</link>. The works that reflect this research, including <i><link label="History of Animals">History of Animals</link></i>, <i><link label="Generation of Animals">Generation of Animals</link></i>, and <i><link label="Parts of Animals">Parts of Animals</link></i>, contain some remarkable observations and interpretations by Aristotle, along with sundry myths and mistakes reflecting the uneven state of knowledge of his time. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on catfish, <link label="Electric ray">electric fish</link> (<link label="Torpedo (genus)">Torpedo</link>) and angler-fish are exceptional, as is his writing on <link label="Cephalopod">cephalopod</link>s, <link label="Molluscs">molluscs</link>, <link label="Octopus">octopus</link>, sepia (<link label="Cuttlefish">cuttlefish</link>) and the paper nautilus (<link label="Argonauta argo">Argonauta argo</link>). His description of the hectocotyl arm (see <link label="Cephalopod">cephalopod</link>) was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the nineteenth century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (<link label="Selachians">selachians</link>).<ref>Singer, Charles. <i>A short history of biology</i>. Oxford 1931.</ref>  He gave accurate descriptions of <link label="Ruminant">ruminant</link>s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the unusual mammal-like embryological development of the <link label="Hound sharks">hound shark</link> <link label="Mustelus laevis">Mustelus laevis</link>.<ref>Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in <i><link label="Oxford Classical Dictionary">Oxford Classical Dictionary</link></i>, 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.</ref></p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Theory of biological being</title>
<p>However, for <link label="Charles Singer">Charles Singer</link>, &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a <i>scala naturae</i>&quot;<ref>Singer, Charles. <i>A short history of biology</i>. Oxford 1931.</ref> Aristotle's <i>History of Animals</i> classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;<link label="Great chain of being">Ladder of Life</link>&quot; (<i>scala naturae</i>), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.<ref>Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.</ref></p>

<p>Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., <link label="Formal cause">formal cause</link>s, guided all natural processes. Such a <link label="Teleological">teleological</link> view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had a multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve type of balance.<ref>Mason, <i>A History of the Sciences</i> pp 43-44</ref> </p>

<p>In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the <i>scala naturae</i> or <link label="Great Chain of Being">Great Chain of Being</link>.<ref>Mayr, <i>The Growth of Biological Thought</i>, pp 201-202; see also: Lovejoy, <i>The Great Chain of Being</i></ref> His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. </p>

<p>Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not foreordained by that form. </p>

<p>He placed great importance on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.<ref> Aristotle, <i>De Anima</i> II 3 </ref> </p>

<p>Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.<ref> Mason, <i>A History of the Sciences</i> pp 45 </ref> Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of <link label="Alcmaeon">Alcmaeon</link>.<ref> Guthrie, <i>A History of Greek Philosophy</i> Vol. 1 pp. 348 </ref></p>

<p>His analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a <link label="Misogyny">misogynist</link>.<ref><template head="cite book"><field name="last">Harding

Aristotle's successor at the <link label="Lyceum">Lyceum</link>, <link label="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</link>, wrote a series of books on botany&amp;mdash;the </i><link label="Historia Plantarum">History of Plants</link><i>&amp;mdash;which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the <link label="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</link>.

<p>Following Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work.

<template head="main"><link label="Aristotelian ethics">Aristotelian ethics</link></template>

<p>Aristotle considered <link label="Ethics">ethics</link> to be a practical science, i.e., one mastered by doing rather than merely reasoning. Further, Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (like <link label="Metaphysics">metaphysics</link> and <link label="Epistemology">epistemology</link>) but is general knowledge. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, <i><link label="Nichomachean Ethics">Nichomachean Ethics</link></i>, in which he outlines what is commonly called <link label="Virtue ethics">virtue ethics</link>.</p>

<p>Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that man must have a function uncommon to anything else, and that this function must be an activity of the soul. Aristotle identified the best activity of the soul as <link label="Eudaimonia">eudaimonia</link>: a happiness or joy that pervades the good life. Aristotle taught that to achieve the good life, one must live a balanced life and avoid excess. This balance, he taught, varies among different persons and situations, and exists as a <link label="Golden mean (philosophy)">golden mean</link> between two vices - one an excess and one a deficiency.</p>

<template head="main"><link label="Politics (Aristotle)">Politics (Aristotle)</link></template>
<p>In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled <i><link label="Politics (Aristotle)">Politics</link></i>. Aristotle's conception of the city is very organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.<ref><template head="cite book"><field name="last">Ebenstein

  </field><field name="id">  </field></template></ref>  Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior to the <link label="Family">family</link> which in turn is prior to the individual, i.e., last in the order of becoming, but first in the order of being (1253a19-24). He is also famous for his statement that &quot;man is by nature a political animal.&quot; Aristotle conceived of politics as being more like an <link label="Organism">organism</link>, rather than a <link label="Machine">machine</link>, and as a collection of parts that cannot exist without the other. Some have criticised Aristotle's political theory on the grounds that his idea of the natural slave was used by thinkers such as <link label="Juan Gines de Sepulveda">Juan Gines de Sepulveda</link> to justify European domination of the American Indians.<template head="Fact"><field name="date">June 2007</field></template></p>

<p>It should be noted that the modern understanding of a political community is that of the <link label="State">state</link>. However, the state was foreign to Aristotle. He referred to political communities as cities. Aristotle understood a city as a political &quot;partnership&quot; (1252a1) and not one of a <link label="Social contract">social contract</link> (or compact) or a political community as understood by <link label="Niccolò Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</link>. Subsequently, a city is created not to avoid injustice or for economic stability (1280b29-31), but rather to live a good life: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&quot; (1281a1-3). This can be distinguished from the social contract theory which individuals leave the <link label="State of nature">state of nature</link> because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Rhetoric and poetics</title>
<template head="main"><link label="Rhetoric (Aristotle)">Poetics (Aristotle)</link></template>
<p>Aristotle considered <link label="Epic poetry">epic poetry</link>, tragedy, comedy, <link label="Dithyramb">dithyrambic poetry</link> and <link label="Music">music</link> to be <link label="Mimesis">imitative</link>, each varying in imitation by media, object, and manner.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i> I 1447a</ref>  For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language.  The forms also differ in their object of imitation.  <link label="Comedy">Comedy</link>, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas <link label="Tragedy">tragedy</link> imitates men slightly better than average.  Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitiation - through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i> III</ref>  Aristotle believed that imitiation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i> IV</ref></p>

<p>While it is believed that Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i> was comprised of two books - one on comedy and one on tragedy - only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived.  Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i> VI</ref>  The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy.  Tragedy is the imitation of action arrousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the <link label="Catharsis">catharsis</link> of those same emotions.  Aristotle concludes <i>Poetics</i> with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis.  He suggest that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.<ref>Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i> XXVI</ref></p>

Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelean corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelean interpolations in the <i><link label="Politics (Aristotle)">Politics</link></i>, for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.</p>

The Italian poet <link label="Dante Alighieri">Dante</link> says of Aristotle in <link label="The Divine Comedy">the first circles of hell</link>,
:<i>I saw the Master there of those who know,</i>

<p>The German philosopher <link label="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</link> has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.<ref>Durant, p. 86</ref> However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue - or <i>arete</i> - of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is <link label="Martin Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</link>, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.
