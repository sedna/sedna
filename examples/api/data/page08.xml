<p>The concept of capitalism has limited analytic value, given the great variety of historical cases over which it is applied, varying in time, geography, politics and culture. Some economists have specified a variety of different types of capitalism, depending on specifics of concentration of economic power and wealth, and methods of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot; /&gt; During the last century capitalism has been contrasted with <link label="Planned economy">centrally planned economies</link>.</p>

<p>The concept of capitalism has evolved over time, with later thinkers often building on the analyses of earlier thinkers. Moreover, the component concepts used in defining capitalism—such as private ownership, markets and investment—have evolved along with changes in theory, in law, and in practice.</p>
<section depth="2"><title>Classical political economy</title>
<p>The &quot;classical&quot; tradition in <link label="History of economic thought">economic thought</link> emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. The classical political economists <link label="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</link>, <link label="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</link>, <link label="Jean-Baptiste Say">Jean-Baptiste Say</link>, and <link label="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</link> published analyses of the production, distribution, and exchange of goods in a capitalist economy that have since formed the basis of study for most contemporary economists. Contributions to this tradition are also found in the earlier work of <link label="David Hume">David Hume</link> and the <link label="Physiocrats">physiocrats</link> like <link label="Richard Cantillon">Richard Cantillon</link>.</p>

<p><link label="Adam Smith">Adam Smith's</link> attack on <link label="Mercantilism">mercantilism</link> and his reasoning for &quot;the system of natural liberty&quot; in <i><link label="The Wealth of Nations">The Wealth of Nations</link></i> (1776) are usually taken as the beginning of classical political economy. Smith devised a set of concepts that remain strongly associated with capitalism today, particularly his theory of the &quot;<link label="Invisible hand">invisible hand</link>&quot; of the market, through which the pursuit of individual self-interest unintentionally produces a collective good for society. He criticized monopolies, tariffs, duties, and other state enforced restrictions of his time and believed that the market is the most fair and efficient arbitrator of resources. This view was shared by <link label="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</link>, second most important of the classical political economists and one of the most influential economists of modern times.<ref>E.K. Hunt, <i>History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective</i>; M.E. Sharpe (2002) p.92</ref> In <i>The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</i> (1817) he developed the law of <link label="Comparative advantage">comparative advantage</link>, which explains why it is profitable for two parties to trade, even if one of the trading partners is more efficient in every type of economic production. This principle supports the economic case for <link label="Free trade">free trade</link>. Ricardo was a supporter of <link label="Say's Law">Say's Law</link> and held the view that full employment is the normal equilibrium for a competitive economy.<ref>&quot;Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought&quot;, Blackwell Publishing (1991), p.91</ref> He also argued that <link label="Inflation">inflation</link> is closely related to changes in quantity of <link label="Money">money</link> and <link label="Credit (finance)">credit</link> and was a proponent of the law of <link label="Diminishing returns">diminishing returns</link>, which states that each additional unit of input yields less and less additional output.<ref>Mark Skousen, &quot;The Making of Modern Economics: The Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers&quot;, M.E. Sharpe (2001), p.98-102</ref></p>

<p>The values of classical political economy are strongly associated with the <link label="Classical liberalism">classical liberal</link> doctrine of minimal government intervention in the economy. Classical liberal thought has generally assumed a clear division between the economy and other realms of social activity, such as the state.<ref>&quot;Capitalism&quot; <i>Dictionary of the Social Sciences</i>.

<img src="Karl Marx.jpg">right|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx</img>]] </p>

<p><link label="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</link> considered capitalism to be a historically specific <link label="Mode of production">mode of production</link> (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding <link label="Social relations of production">social relations</link> between individuals based on their connection with the process of production) in which capital has become the dominant <link label="Mode of production">mode of production</link>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot;&gt; Peter Burnham, &quot;Capitalism&quot; <i>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics</i>. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist stage of development or &quot;bourgeois society,&quot; for Marx, represented the most advanced form of social organization to date.    
    
Following Adam Smith, Marx distinguished the <link label="Use value">use value</link> of commodities from their <link label="Exchange value">exchange value</link> in the market. <link label="Capital (economics)">Capital</link>, according to Marx, is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of <link label="Labor power">labor power</link> had itself become a commodity under capitalism; the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist. This difference in values, he argues, constitutes <link label="Surplus value">surplus value</link>, which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book <i><link label="Das Kapital">Capital</link></i>, Marx argues that the capitalist mode of production is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers—all prior societies had extracted <link label="Surplus labor">surplus labor</link>, but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm</field><field name="title"> Capital. v. 3.

For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the bourgeoisie becomes the basis of <link label="Class struggle">class struggle</link>. However, this argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the <link label="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</link> asserting that labor is the source of all value, and thus of profit. This theory is contested by most current <link label="Economist">economist</link>s, including some contemporary Marxian economists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot; /&gt; One line of subsequent Marxian thinking sees the centrally-planned economic systems of existing &quot;communist&quot; societies that were still based on exploitation of labor as &quot;<link label="State capitalism">state capitalism</link>.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;state capitalism&quot;&gt;Early proponents of the term &quot;state capitalism&quot; include, for example, <link label="Tony Cliff">Tony Cliff</link>, <link label="Raya Dunayevskaya">Raya Dunayevskaya</link>, <link label="CLR James">CLR James</link> and <link label="Paul Mattick">Paul Mattick</link>. <link label="Ernest Mandel">Ernest Mandel</link> has been a particularly prominent advocate of the analysis of post-WWII conditions as <link label="State capitalism">state capitalism</link>.

<p><img src="Max Weber 1917.jpg">thumb|300px|[[Max Weber</img> in <link label="1917">1917</link>]]</p>

<p>In some <link label="Social science">social science</link>s, the understanding of the defining characteristics of capitalism has been strongly influenced by 19th century German social theorist <link label="Max Weber">Max Weber</link>. Weber considered <link label="Market">market</link> <link label="Exchange">exchange</link>, rather than production, as the defining feature of capitalism; capitalist enterprises, in contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, was their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing <link label="Efficiency">efficiency</link> and <link label="Productivity (economics)">productivity</link>. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between <link label="Master craftsman">master</link> and <link label="Journeyman">journeyman</link> in a <link label="Guild">guild</link>, or between <link label="Lord">lord</link> and <link label="Peasant">peasant</link> in a <link label="Manorialism">manor</link>.<ref>http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y64l10.html</ref></p>

<p>In his book <i><link label="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</link></i> (1904-1905), Weber sought to trace how capitalism transformed traditional modes of economic activity.   For Weber, the 'spirit' of rational calculation eroded traditional restraints on capitalist exchange, and fostered the development of modern capitalism. This 'spirit' was gradually codified by law; rendering wage-laborers legally 'free' to sell work; encouraging the development of technology aimed at the organization of production on the basis of rational principles; and clarifying the separation of the public and private lives of workers, especially between the home and the workplace. Therefore, unlike Marx, Weber did not see capitalism as primarily the consequence of changes in the means of production.<ref>http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/WEBER/WeberCH2.html</ref> Instead, for Weber the origins of capitalism rested chiefly in the rise of a new <link label="Entrepreneur">entrepreneur</link>ial 'spirit' in the political and cultural realm. In the <i>Protestant Ethic</i>, Weber suggested that the origin of this 'spirit' was related to the rise of <link label="Protestantism">Protestantism</link>, particularly <link label="Calvinism">Calvinism</link>.</p>

<p>Capitalism, for Weber, is the most advanced economic system ever developed over the course of human history. Weber associated capitalism with the advance of the business <link label="Corporation">corporation</link>, public credit, and the further advance of <link label="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</link> of the modern world. Although Weber defended capitalism against its socialist critics of the period, he saw its rationalizing tendencies as a possible threat to traditional cultural values and institutions, and a possible 'iron cage' constraining human freedom.<ref>www.economyandsociety.com/events/Ethic&amp;SpiritCapsm_Conf_Agenda2.pdf</ref></p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>The German Historical School and the Austrian School</title>
<p>From the perspective of the <link label="Historical school of economics">German Historical School</link>, capitalism is primarily identified in terms of the organization of production for <link label="Market">market</link>s. Although this perspective shares similar theoretical roots with that of Weber, its emphasis on markets and <link label="Money">money</link> lends it different focus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt;  For followers of the German Historical School, the key shift from traditional modes of economic activity to capitalism involved the shift from medieval restrictions on credit and money to the modern <link label="Monetary system">monetary economy</link> combined with an emphasis on the profit motive.</p>

<p><img src="MisesLibrary.jpg">thumb|left|193px|[[Ludwig von Mises</img>]]</p>

<p>In the late 19th century the German historical school of economics diverged with the emerging <link label="Austrian School">Austrian School</link> of economics, led at the time by <link label="Carl Menger">Carl Menger</link>. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist <link label="Joseph Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</link>, a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the &quot;<link label="Creative destruction">creative destruction</link>&quot; of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change. At any moment of time, posits Schumpeter, there are rising industries and declining industries. Schumpeter, and many contemporary economists influenced by his work, argue that resources should flow from the declining to the expanding industries for an economy to grow, but they recognized that sometimes resources are slow to withdraw from the declining industries because of various forms of institutional resistance to change.</p>

<p>The Austrian economists <link label="Ludwig von Mises">Ludwig von Mises</link> and <link label="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</link> were among the leading defenders of <link label="Market capitalism">market capitalism</link> against 20th century proponents of socialist <link label="Planned economies">planned economies</link>. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy. Since a modern economy produces such a large array of distinct goods and services, and consists of such a large array of consumers and enterprises, asserted Mises and Hayek, the information problems facing any other form of economic organization other than market capitalism would exceed its capacity to handle information. Thinkers within <link label="Supply-side economics">Supply-side economics</link> built on the work of the Austrian School, and particular emphasize <link label="Say's Law">Say's Law</link>: &quot;supply creates its own demand.&quot;  Capitalism, to this school, is defined by lack of state restraint on the decisions of producers.</p>

<p>Austrian economics has been a major influence on the ideology of <link label="Libertarianism">libertarianism</link>, which considers <link label="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</link> capitalism to be the ideal economic system.</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Keynesian economics</title>

<p><img src="John Maynard Keynes.jpg">thumb|right|150px|[[John Maynard Keynes</img>]]</p>

<p>In his 1937 <i><link label="The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money">The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</link></i>, the British economist <link label="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</link> argued that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite <link label="Economic equilibrium">equilibrium</link> despite high <link label="Unemployment">unemployment</link>. Essentially rejecting <link label="Say's law">Say's law</link>, he argued that some people may have a <link label="Liquidity preference">liquidity preference</link> which would see them rather hold money than buy new goods or services, which therefore raised the prospect that the <link label="Great Depression">Great Depression</link> would not end without what he termed in the <i>General Theory</i> &quot;a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment.&quot;</p>

<p>Keynesian economics challenged the notion that laissez-faire capitalist economics could operate well on their own, without state intervention used to promote aggregate demand, fighting high unemployment and <link label="Deflation (economics)">deflation</link> of the sort seen during the 1930s. He and his followers recommended &quot;<link label="Deficit spending">pump-priming</link>&quot; the economy to avoid <link label="Recession">recession</link>: cutting taxes, increasing government borrowing, and spending during an economic down-turn. This was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of <link label="Inflation">inflation</link> to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money.<ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch01.htm </field><field name="title">Marx and Keynes: the limits of the mixed economy </field><field name="author">Paul Mattick </field><field name="accessmonthday">August 31 </field><field name="accessyear">2006 </field></template> (Originally published Extending Horizons Books/Porter Sargent Publisher Boston, 1969)</ref>  The premises of Keynes’s work have, however, since been challenged by neoclassical and <link label="Supply-side economics">supply-side economics</link> and the Austrian School.</p>

<p>Another challenge to Keynesian thinking came from his colleague <link label="Piero Sraffa">Piero Sraffa</link>, and subsequently from the <link label="Neo-Ricardianism">Neo-Ricardian school</link> that followed Sraffa. In Sraffa's highly-technical analysis, capitalism is defined by an entire system of social relations among both producers and consumers, but with a primary emphasis on the demands of production. According to Sraffa, the tendency of capital to seek its highest rate of profit causes a dynamic instability in social and economic relations.</p>

<p>Today, most academic research on capitalism in the English-speaking world draws on <link label="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical economic thought</link>. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights, rather than privileging particular social actors; deregulated <link label="Labor market">labor market</link>s; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on <link label="Capital market">capital market</link>-based financing rather than state financing.</p>

<p>The <link label="Chicago school (economics)">Chicago School of economics</link> is best known for its free market advocacy and <link label="Monetarist">monetarist</link> ideas. According to <link label="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</link> and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable <link label="Laissez-faire">if left to themselves</link> and depressions result only from government intervention.<ref>&quot;Macroeconomics and New Macroeconomics,&quot; by Bernhard Felderer, Stefan Homburg</ref> Friedman, for example, argued that the Great Depression was result of a contraction of the money supply, controlled by the <link label="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve</link>, and not by the lack of investment as Keynes had argued. <link label="Ben Bernanke">Ben Bernanke</link>, current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;fed&quot;&gt;<external href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm">Speech by Ben Bernanke, November 8, 2002</external>, The Federal Reserve Board, retrieved October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; </p>

<p>Neoclassical economists, which today are the majority of economists,<ref>Yuval P. Yonary. <i>The Struggle Over the Soul of Economics</i> (1998). Princeton University Press.

<template head="Main"><field>History of capitalism</field></template>

<p>Private ownership of some means of production has existed at least in a small degree since the invention of agriculture. Some writers see medieval <link label="Guilds">guilds</link> as forerunners of the modern capitalist concern (especially through using <link label="Apprentices">apprentices</link> as a kind of paid laborer); but economic activity was bound by customs and controls which, along with the rule of the <link label="Aristocracy">aristocracy</link> which would expropriate wealth through arbitrary fines, taxes and enforced loans, meant that <link label="Profit">profit</link>s were difficult to accumulate.

<p>In the period between the late 15th century and the late 18th century the institution of private property was brought into existence in the full, legal meaning of the term.

<p>An earlier system from which capitalism evolved, arising in the period between the 16th and 18th centuries, is commonly described as <link label="Merchant capitalism">merchant capitalism</link> and <link label="Mercantilism">mercantilism</link>&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; (EB). This period was associated with geographic discoveries by merchant overseas traders, especially from England and the Low Countries; the <link label="European colonization of the Americas">European colonization of the Americas</link>; and the rapid growth in overseas trade. The associated rise of a bourgeoisie class eclipsed the prior feudal system. It is mercantilism that Adam Smith refuted in his Wealth of Nations which is a recognized treatise of capitalist theory.</p>

<p>Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot; /&gt;  Noting the various pre-capitalist features of mercantilism, <link label="Karl Polanyi">Karl Polanyi</link> argued that capitalism did not emerge until the establishment of <link label="Free trade">free trade</link> in Britain in the 1830s.</p>

<p>Under mercantilism, European <link label="Merchant">merchant</link>s, backed by state controls, <link label="Subsidy">subsidies</link>, and <link label="Monopoly">monopolies</link>, made most of their profits from the buying and selling of goods. In the words of <link label="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</link>, the purpose of mercantilism was &quot;the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices…&quot;<ref>Quoted in Sir George Clark, <i>The Seventeenth Century</i> (New York: Oxford University Pres, 1961), p. 24.</ref> Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in the medieval towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of <link label="Absolutism (European history)">absolutism</link>, the state superseded the local <link label="Guild">guild</link>s as the regulator of the economy.</p>

<p>Among the major tenets of mercantilist theory was <link label="Bullionism">bullionism</link>, a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating <link label="Precious metals">precious metals</link>. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists asserted that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported; and promoted government subsidies, such as the granting of monopolies and protective <link label="Tariff">tariff</link>s, were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.</p>

<p>Proponents of mercantilism emphasized state power and overseas conquest as the principal aim of economic policy. If a state could not supply its own raw materials, according to the mercantilists, it should acquire colonies from which they could be extracted. Colonies constituted not only sources of supply for raw materials but also markets for finished products. Because it was not in the interests of the state to allow competition, held the mercantilists, colonies should be prevented from engaging in manufacturing and trading with foreign powers.</p>

<p>Mercantilism declined in Great Britain in the mid-18th century, when a new group of economic theorists, led by <link label="David Hume">David Hume</link><ref>David Hume. <i>Political Discourses</i>. Edinburgh, A. Kincaid &amp; A. Donaldson (1752)</ref> and <link label="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</link>, challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines as the belief that the amount of the world’s wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state. However, in more undeveloped economies, such as <link label="Prussia">Prussia</link> and <link label="Imperial Russia">Russia</link>, with their much younger manufacturing bases, mercantilism continued to find favor after other states had turned to newer doctrines.</p>

<p>The mid-18th century gave rise to industrial capitalism, made possible by the accumulation of vast amounts of capital under the merchant phase of capitalism and its investment in machinery. Industrial capitalism, which Marx dated from the last third of the 18th century, marked the development of the <link label="Factory">factory</link> system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex <link label="Division of labor">division of labor</link> between and within work process and the routinization of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>During the resulting <link label="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</link>, the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system and affected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of <link label="Artisan">artisan</link>s, <link label="Guild">guild</link>s, and <link label="Journeyman">journeymen</link>. Also during this period, capitalism marked the transformation of relations between the British landowning gentry and peasants, giving rise to the production of <link label="Cash crop">cash crop</link>s for the market rather than for subsistence on a <link label="Feudal">feudal</link> <link label="Manorialism">manor</link>. The surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture.</p>

<p>The rise of industrial capitalism was also associated with the decline of mercantilism. Mid- to late-nineteenth-century Britain is widely regarded as the classic case of <link label="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</link> capitalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt;  Laissez-faire gained favor over mercantilism in Britain in the 1840s with the repeal of the <link label="Corn Laws">Corn Laws</link> and the <link label="Navigation Acts">Navigation Acts</link>. In line with the teachings of the classical political economists, led by <link label="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</link> and <link label="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</link>, Britain embraced <link label="Classical liberalism">liberalism</link>, encouraging competition and the development of a <link label="Market economy">market economy</link>.</p>

<p>Late 19th and early 20th century capitalism has also been described as an era of &quot;<link label="Monopoly capitalism">monopoly capitalism</link>,&quot; marked by movement from <link label="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</link> ideology and government policies to the concentration of capital into large monopolistic or <link label="Oligopoly">oligopolistic</link> holdings by banks and financiers, and characterized by the growth of large <link label="Corporation">corporation</link>s and a division of labor separating <link label="Shareholder">shareholder</link>s, owners, and managers.<ref>The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, &quot;Capitalism&quot; by John Scott and Gordon Marshall in A Dictionary of Sociology Oxford University Press 2005.

<p>By the last quarter of the 19th century, the emergence of large industrial trusts had provoked legislation in the U.S. to reduce the monopolistic tendencies of the period.

<p>In the period following the global depression of the 1930s, the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world. In 1929, for example, total U.S. government expenditures (federal, state, and local) amounted to less than one-tenth of <link label="GNP">GNP</link>; from the 1970s they amounted to around one-third (EB).

Although overseas trade has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years, some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with <link label="Globalization">globalization</link> have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the 20th century, combining to circumscribe the room to maneuver of states in choosing non-capitalist models of development.

<p>Austrian School economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or planning mechanism. Friedrich Hayek coined the term &quot;<link label="Catallaxy">catallaxy</link>&quot; to describe what he considered the phenomenon of <link label="Self-organization">self-organization</link> underpinning capitalism. From this perspective, in process of self-organization, the <link label="Profit">profit</link> motive has an important role. From transactions between buyers and sellers price systems emerge, and prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people. The promise of profits gives entrepreneurs incentive to use their knowledge and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated.<ref>Herbert Walberg, Joseph Bast. <i>Education and Capitalism</i>, Hoover Institution Press (2001) p. 87-89 ISBN 0-8179-3972-5 </ref> </p>

<p>This decentralized system of coordination is viewed by some supporters of capitalism as one of its greatest strengths. They argue that it permits many solutions to be tried, and that real-world competition generally finds a good solution to emerging challenges. In contrast, they argue, <link label="Central planning">central planning</link> often selects inappropriate solutions as a result of faulty forecasting. However, in all existing modern economies, the state conducts some degree of <link label="Planned economy">centralized economic planning</link> (using such tools as allowing the country's <link label="Central bank">central bank</link> to set base <link label="Interest rates">interest rates</link>), ostensibly as an attempt to improve efficiency, attenuate cyclical volatility, and further particular social goals. Proponents who follow the Austrian School argue that even this limited control creates inefficiencies because we cannot predict the long-term activity of the economy.

<template head="main"><link label="Criticisms of capitalism">Anti-capitalism</link></template><p><i></i></p>

<p>Capitalism has met with strong opposition throughout its history. Most of the criticism came from the left, but some from the right, and some from religious elements. Many 19th century conservatives were among the most strident critics of capitalism, seeing market exchange and commodity production as threats to cultural and religious traditions. Some critics of capitalism consider economic regulation necessary in order to reduce corruption, negligence, and a slew of other problems they attribute to free markets.</p>

<p>Prominent leftist critics have included socialists like <link label="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</link>, <link label="Frantz Fanon">Frantz Fanon</link>, <link label="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</link>, <link label="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</link>, <link label="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</link>, <link label="Antonio Gramsci">Antonio Gramsci</link> and <link label="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</link> and <link label="Anarchism">anarchists</link> including <link label="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</link>, <link label="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</link>, <link label="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</link>, <link label="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</link>, <link label="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</link>, <link label="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</link>, <link label="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</link>, <link label="Rudolf Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</link>, <link label="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</link>, and others. Movements like the <link label="Luddite">Luddite</link>s, <link label="Narodnik">Narodnik</link>s, <link label="Shakers">Shakers</link>, <link label="Utopian socialism">Utopian Socialists</link> and others have opposed capitalism for various reasons. Marxism has influenced the creation of <link label="Social democratic">social democratic</link> and <link label="Labour Party">labour parties</link>, which seek change through existing democratic channels instead of revolution. These parties believe that capitalism should be heavily regulated rather than abolished. Many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the relatively recent <link label="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</link> movement.</p>

<p>Some religions criticize or outright oppose specific elements of capitalism. Some traditions of <link label="Judaism">Judaism</link>, <link label="Christianity">Christianity</link>, and <link label="Islam">Islam</link> forbid <link label="Usury">lending money at interest</link>, although methods of <link label="Islamic banking">Islamic banking</link> have been developed. Christianity has been a source of both praise and criticism for capitalism, particularly its <link label="Economic materialism">materialist</link> aspects.<ref> e.g. The <link label="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</link> has condemned, &quot;in the practice of 'capitalism,' individualism and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human labor.&quot;<external href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8C.HTM#-2FX">Catechism of the Catholic Church, §2425</external></ref> The first socialists drew many of their principles from Christian values (see <link label="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</link>), against &quot;bourgeois&quot; values of profiteering, greed, selfishness, and hoarding. Christian critics of capitalism may not oppose capitalism entirely, but support a mixed economy in order to ensure adequate labor standards and relations, as well as economic justice. There are many <link label="Protestant">Protestant</link> denominations (particularly in the United States) who have reconciled with — or are ardently in favor of — capitalism, particularly in opposition to secular socialism. However, in the US and around the world there are many Protestant Christian traditions which critique or even outrightly oppose capitalism. The Indian philosopher <link label="P.R. Sarkar">P.R. Sarkar</link> and founder of the <link label="Ananda Marga">Ananda Marga</link> movement is another critic, with his <link label="Social cycle theory (Sarkar)">Social Cycle Theory</link>. His proposed solution is the <link label="Progressive Utilisation Theory">Progressive Utilisation Theory</link> (PROUT).<ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.prout.org/aftercapitalism/ </field><field name="title">After Capitalism </field><field name="author">Dada Maheshvarananda </field><field name="accessmonthday">June 13 </field><field name="accessyear">2007</field></template></ref><ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.proutworld.org/</field><field name="title">proutworld</field></template></ref></p>

<p>Some problems claimed to be associated with capitalism include: seemingly unfair and inefficient <link label="Distribution of wealth">distribution of wealth</link> and power; a tendency toward market <link label="Monopoly">monopoly</link> or <link label="Oligopoly">oligopoly</link> (and government by <link label="Oligarchy">oligarchy</link>); <link label="Imperialism">imperialism</link>, various forms of economic <link label="Exploitation">exploitation</link>; and phenomena such as <link label="Social alienation">social alienation</link>, <link label="Inequality">inequality</link>, <link label="Unemployment">unemployment</link>, and economic instability. Critics have maintained that there is an inherent tendency towards oligolopolistic structures when laissez-faire is combined with capitalist private property. Because of this tendency either laissez-faire, or private property, or both, have drawn fire from critics who believe an essential aspect of economic freedom is the extension of the freedom to have meaningful decision-making control over productive resources to everyone. Economist Branko Horvat explains, &quot;it is now well known that capitalist development leads to the concentration of capital, employment and power. It is somewhat less known that it leads to the almost complete destruction of economic freedom.&quot;.<ref>B.Horvat, The Political Economy of Socialism,Armonk, NY,M.E.Sharpe,Inc, p.11 </ref></p>

<p>Near the start of the 20th century, Vladimir Lenin claimed that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism.<ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm </field><field name="title">Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism </field><field name="author">Vladimir Lenin </field><field name="accessmonthday">June 29 </field><field name="accessyear">2006</field></template></ref> This concept of <link label="Political economy">political economy</link> concerning the relationship between economic and political power among and within states includes critics of capitalism who allege the system is responsible for not only economic <link label="Exploitation">exploitation</link>, but <link label="Imperialism">imperialist</link>, <link label="Colonialist">colonialist</link> and <link label="Counter-revolutionary">counter-revolutionary</link> wars, repressions of workers and trade unionists, <link label="Genocides">genocides</link>, <link label="Massacres">massacres</link> and so on. For example <link label="The Black Book of Capitalism">The Black Book of Capitalism</link> concludes that capitalism has killed approximately 147 million people between 1500-1997.<template head="Fact"><field name="date">November 2007</field></template> Authors consider that, for example, capitalism is responsible for the death of 70M people during the colonization of Americas or 50M during World War II. </p>

<p>There are environmentalists who claim that capitalism requires continual economic growth, and will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of the earth, and other resources utilized broadly. Those environmentalists, such as <link label="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</link>, have argued that capitalist production passes on environmental costs to all of society, and is unable to consider its impact upon ecosystems and the biosphere at large.</p>

<p>Some <link label="Labor history">labor historians</link> and other scholars, such as Immanuel Wallerstein and Marcel van der Linden, have also argued that <link label="Unfree labour">unfree labor</link> &amp;mdash; the use of a labor force comprised of <link label="Slavery">slaves</link>, <link label="Indentured servant">indentured servant</link>s, criminal convicts, political prisoners and/or other coerced persons &amp;mdash; is compatible with capitalist relations.<ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html </field><field name="title">&quot;Labour History as the History of Multitudes&quot;, <i>Labour/Le Travail</i>, 52, Fall 2003, p. 235-244 </field><field name="author">Marcel van der Linden </field><field name="accessmonthday">December 9 </field><field name="accessyear">2006</field></template></ref></p>

<template head="Main"><field>History of theory of capitalism</field></template>

<p>The relationship between the <link label="State">state</link>, its formal mechanisms, and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. <link label="Hernando de Soto (economist)">Hernando de Soto</link> is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref><template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm </field><field name="title">The mystery of capital</field><field name="author"> Hernando de Soto</field><field name="accessmonthday">September 6 </field><field name="accessyear">2006</field></template></ref> According to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the <link label="Enclosure Acts">Enclosure Acts</link> in <link label="England">England</link>, and similar legislation elsewhere, were an integral part of capitalist <link label="Primitive accumulation">primitive accumulation</link> and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>The basis for this claim largely draws from Marx: <template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm </field><field name="title">Capital, v. 1. Part VIII: primitive accumulation</field><field name="author"> Karl Marx</field><field name="accessmonthday">September 4 </field><field name="accessyear">2006</field></template>.

<p><link label="New institutional economics">New institutional economics</link>, a field pioneered by <link label="Douglass North">Douglass North</link>, stresses the need of capitalism for a legal framework to function optimally, and focuses on the relationship between the historical development of capitalism and the creation and maintenance of political and economic institutions.<ref>North, Douglass C. <i>Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance</i>, Cambridge University Press, 1990.</ref> In new institutional economics and other fields focusing on public policy, economists seek to judge when and whether governmental intervention (such as <link label="Tax">tax</link>es, <link label="Welfare (financial aid)">welfare</link>, and <link label="Regulatory economics">government regulation</link>) can result in potential gains in efficiency. According to <link label="Gregory Mankiw">Gregory Mankiw</link>, a <link label="New Keynesian economics">New Keynesian economist</link>, governmental intervention can improve on market outcomes under conditions of &quot;<link label="Market failure">market failure</link>,&quot; or situations in which the market on its own does not allocate resources efficiently.<ref>N. Gregory Mankiw, <i>Principles of Economics</i> Harvard University, 1997. p. 10.</ref> The idea of market failure is that markets fail to realize all potential gains from trade. This means that markets fail to deliver perfect economic results. Critics of market failure theory, like <link label="Ronald Coase">Ronald Coase</link>, <link label="Harold Demsetz">Harold Demsetz</link>, and <link label="James M. Buchanan">James M. Buchanan</link> argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection. Market failures are often small, and government failures are sometimes large. It is therefore the case that imperfect markets are often better than imperfect governmental alternatives. While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed. One recent study (see Dawson in Kyklos 2007) indicates increased regulation impairs economic performance. </p>

<p>The relationship between <link label="Democracy">democracy</link> and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and popular political movements. The extension of universal adult male <link label="Suffrage">suffrage</link> in 19th century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism, and democracy become widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading many theorists to posit a causal relationship between them, or that each affects the other. However, in the 20th century, according to some authors, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including <link label="Fascism">fascist</link> regimes, monarchies, and single-party states,&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; while it has been observed that some ostensibly democratic regimes such as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela have been expressly anti-capitalist. While some thinkers argue that capitalist development more-or-less inevitably eventually leads to the emergence of democracy, others dispute this claim. Research on the <link label="Democratic peace theory">democratic peace theory</link> further argue that capitalist democracies rarely make war with one another and have little internal violence.<ref>For example, see <template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm </field><field name="title">Does democracy cause peace</field><field name="author"> James Lee Ray</field><field name="accessmonthday">September 6 </field><field name="accessyear">2006</field></template> and <template head="cite web"><field name="url">http://www.worldbank.org/research/conflict/papers/peace.htm </field><field name="title">Towards a democratic civil peace? : opportunity, grievance, and civil war 1816-1992</field><field name="author"> Håvard Hegre ...[et al]</field><field name="accessmonthday">September 6 </field><field name="accessyear">2006</field></template></ref></p>

<p>Some commentators argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future. Under this line of thinking, authoritarian regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom.<ref>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, George W. Downs, <external href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84507/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita-george-w-downs/development-and-democracy.html">“Development and Democracy”</external>, <i><link label="Foreign Affairs">Foreign Affairs</link></i>, September/October 2005.

<p>In response to criticism of the system, some proponents of capitalism have argued that its advantages are supported by empirical research. For example, advocates of different <link label="Index of Economic Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</link> point to a statistical correlation between nations with more economic freedom (as defined by the Indices) and higher scores on variables such as income and life expectancy, including the poor in these nations. Some peer-reviewed studies find evidence for causation.<ref>http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf</ref></p>
</section></section><section depth="1"><title>Capitalist Philosophy</title>
<template head="Main"><field>Culture of Capitalism</field></template>

<p>Capitalism has been defined by some as a philosophym just as Communism has by communists. It is described by them as a philosophy of personal attainment and achievement. It stresses the accumulaton of wealth or Capital by individuals. However, the term &quot;Wealth&quot; is often mis-understood by anti-capitalists. Wealth, in Capitalist terminology, is defined as anything which an individula can personally attain. A good example of wealth in Capitalist terminology that is not usually considered wealth by others is spiritual fufilment. Capitalists claim that, as it can be attained by an individual human and can be given to others or kept by the individual, it is wealth. 
Capitalists regard this attainment of wealth as the main driving force behind humanity. This driving force continues to push humanity forward. Capitalists regard advancement as one of the ultimate goals of humanity as a whole. As individuals advance themselves, they advance the rest of society with them.</p>
