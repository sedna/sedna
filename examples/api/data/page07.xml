</summary><section depth="1"><title>Family</title>

<p>Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking <link label="Jew">Jew</link>ish family in <link label="Prague">Prague</link>, the capital of <link label="Bohemia">Bohemia</link>. His father, Hermann Kafka (1852&amp;ndash;1931), was described as a &quot;huge, selfish, overbearing businessman&quot; (Corngold 1973) and by Kafka himself as &quot;a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature ...&quot;.<ref><external href="http://www.kafka-franz.com/KAFKA-letter.htm">Franz Kafka's Letter to his father</external> www.kafka-franz.com</ref> Kafka struggled to come to terms with his domineering father. Hermann was the fourth child of Jacob Kafka, a <link label="Shochet">shochet</link>, and came to Prague from Osek, a Czech-speaking Jewish village near <link label="Písek">Písek</link> in southern Bohemia. After working as a traveling sales representative, he established himself as an independent retailer of men's and women's fancy goods and accessories, employing up to 15 people and using a <link label="Jackdaw">jackdaw</link> (<i>kavka</i> in Czech) as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie (1856&amp;mdash;1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous brewer in <link label="Poděbrady">Poděbrady</link>, and was better educated than her husband.<ref>Gilman, Sander L. (2005) &quot;Franz Kafka&quot;. <i>Reaktion Books Ltd. London, UK.</i> p.20-21. ISBN 1-88187-264-5.</ref> </p>

<p>Kafka was the eldest of six children.<ref>Hamalian ([1975], 3).</ref> He had two younger brothers, Georg and Heinrich, who died at the ages of fifteen months and six months, respectively, before Kafka was seven, and three younger sisters, Gabriele (&quot;Elli&quot;) (1889–1941), Valerie (&quot;Valli&quot;) (1890–1942), and Ottilie (&quot;Ottla&quot;) (1891–1943). On business days, both parents were absent from the home. His mother helped to manage her husband's business and worked in it as much as 12 hours a day. The children were largely reared by a series of governesses and servants.</p>

<p>Kafka's sisters were sent with their families to the <link label="Łódź Ghetto">Łódź ghetto</link> and died there or in concentration camps. Ottla was sent to the concentration camp at <link label="Concentration camp Theresienstadt">Theresienstadt</link> and then on October 7, 1943 to the <link label="Death camp">death camp</link> at <link label="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz</link>, where 1267 children and 51 guardians, including Ottla, were gassed to death on their arrival.<ref>Danuta Czech: Kalendarz wydarzeń w KL Auschwitz, Oświęcim 1992, p. 534. In the archives of the camp a list with the names of the guardians was preserved.</ref></p>
</section><section depth="1"><title>Education</title>
<p><img src="Prague Palace Kinsky PC.jpg">thumb|left|Kinsky Palace where Kafka attended gymnasium and where his father later owned a shop</img>
Kafka learned German as his first language, but he was also fluent in Czech. Later, Kafka also acquired some knowledge of <link label="French language">French language</link> and culture; one of his favorite authors was <link label="Flaubert">Flaubert</link>. From 1889 to 1893, he attended the <i>Deutsche Knabenschule</i>, the boys' elementary school at the <i>Masný trh/Fleischmarkt</i> (meat market), the street now known as Masná street. His <link label="Judaism">Jewish</link> education was limited to his <i><link label="B'nai Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</link></i> celebration at 13 and going to the <link label="Synagogue">synagogue</link> four times a year with his father.<ref><external href="http://www.kafka-franz.com/kafka-Biography.htm">Franz Kafka Biography</external> www.kafka-franz.com</ref> After elementary school, he was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state <i>gymnasium</i>, <i>Altstädter Deutsches Gymnasium</i>, an academic secondary school with eight grade levels, where German was also the language of instruction, at <link label="Old Town Square">Old Town Square</link>, within the Kinsky Palace. He completed his <link label="Maturita">Maturita</link> exams in 1901. </p>

<p>Admitted to the <link label="German Charles-Ferdinand University">German Charles-Ferdinand University</link> of Prague, Kafka first studied chemistry, but switched after two weeks to law. This offered a range of career possibilities, which pleased his father, and required a longer course of study that gave Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. At the university, he joined a student club, named <i>Lese- und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten</i>, which organized literary events, readings and other activities. In the end of his first year of studies, he met <link label="Max Brod">Max Brod</link>, who would become a close friend of his throughout his life, together with the journalist <link label="Felix Weltsch">Felix Weltsch</link>, who also studied law. Kafka obtained the degree of Doctor of Law on <link label="June 18">June 18</link>, <link label="1906">1906</link> and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;esp&quot;/&gt;</p>
<section depth="2"><title>Work</title>  
<p>On <link label="November 1">November 1</link>, <link label="1907">1907</link>, he was hired at the <link label="Assicurazioni Generali">Assicurazioni Generali</link>, a huge Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence, during that period, witnesses that he was unhappy with his working time schedule - from 8 p.m. (20:00) until 6 a.m. (06:00) - as it made it extremely difficult for him to concentrate on his writing. On <link label="July 15">July 15</link>, <link label="1908">1908</link>, he resigned, and two weeks later found more congenial employment with the Worker's Accident <link label="Insurance">Insurance</link> Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. His father often referred to his son's job as insurance officer as a &quot;Brotberuf&quot;, literally &quot;bread job&quot;, a job done only to pay the bills. However, he did not show any signs of indifference towards his job, as the several promotions that he received during his career prove that he was a hardworking employee. A little-known fact about this period, reported by <link label="Peter Drucker">Peter Drucker</link> in <i>Managing in the Next Society</i>, is that Kafka invented the first civilian <link label="Hard hat">hard hat</link>. He received a medal for this invention in 1912 because it reduced Bohemian steel mill deaths to fewer than 25 per thousand employees. He was also given the task of compiling and composing the annual report and was reportedly quite proud of the results, sending copies to friends and family. In parallel, Kafka was also committed to his literary work. Together with his close friends <link label="Max Brod">Max Brod</link> and <link label="Felix Weltsch">Felix Weltsch</link>, these three were called &quot;Der enge Prager Kreis&quot;, the close Prague circle, which was part of a broader Prague Circle, &quot;a loosely knit group of German-Jewish writers who contributed to the culturally fertile soil of Prague during the 1880s until after World War I.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Czermak&quot;&gt;<i>The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, notes. Herberth Czermak. Lincoln, Nebraska: Cliffs Notes 1973, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;</i></p>

<p>In 1911, Karl Hermann, spouse of his sister Elli, proposed Kafka collaborate in the operation of an <link label="Asbestos">asbestos</link> factory known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann and Co. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business. During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of <link label="Yiddish theatre">Yiddish theatre</link>, despite the misgivings of even close friends such as Max Brod, who usually supported him in everything else. Those performances also served as a starting point for his growing relationship with <link label="Judaism">Judaism</link>.</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Later years</title>  
<p>In 1912, at the home of his lifelong friend <link label="Max Brod">Max Brod</link>, Kafka met <link label="Felice Bauer">Felice Bauer</link>, who lived in Berlin and worked as a representative for a dictaphone company. Over the next five years they corresponded a great deal, met occasionally, and twice were engaged to be married. Their relationship finally ended in 1917. </p>

<p>In 1917, Kafka began to suffer from <link label="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</link>, which would require frequent convalescence during which he was supported by his family, most notably his sister Ottla. Despite his fear of being perceived as both physically and mentally repulsive, he impressed others with his boyish, neat, and austere good looks, a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence and dry sense of humor.<ref><external href="http://www.amrep.org/articles/3_3c/disappearing.html">Ryan McKittrick speaks with director Dominique Serrand and Gideon Lester about Amerika</external> www.amrep.org</ref> </p>

<p>In the early 1920s he developed an intense relationship with Czech journalist and writer <link label="Milena Jesenská">Milena Jesenská</link>. In 1923, he briefly moved to <link label="Berlin">Berlin</link> in the hope of distancing himself from his family's influence to concentrate on his writing. In Berlin, he lived with <link label="Dora Diamant">Dora Diamant</link>, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family, who was independent enough to have escaped her past in the ghetto. Dora became his lover, and influenced Kafka's interest in the <link label="Talmud">Talmud</link>.<ref><external href="http://www.atlegerhardsen.com/pages/lothar_hempel/presse_eng_0802.htm">Lothar Hempel</external> www.atlegerhardsen.com</ref> </p>

<p>It is generally agreed that Kafka suffered from <link label="Clinical depression">clinical depression</link> and <link label="Social anxiety">social anxiety</link> throughout his entire life <template head="Fact"><field name="date">March 2007</field></template>. He also suffered from <link label="Migraine">migraine</link>s, insomnia, <link label="Constipation">constipation</link>, boils, and other ailments, all usually brought on by excessive stresses and strains. He attempted to counteract all of this by a regimen of <link label="Naturopathic Medicine">naturopathic</link> treatments, such as a <link label="Vegetarianism">vegetarian</link> diet and the consumption of large quantities of unpasteurized milk. However, Kafka's tuberculosis worsened; he returned to Prague, then went to Dr. Hoffmann <link label="Sanatorium">sanatorium</link> in Kierling near <link label="Vienna">Vienna</link> for treatment, where he died on <link label="June 3">June 3</link>, <link label="1924">1924</link>, apparently from starvation. The condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since <link label="Intravenous therapy">intravenous therapy</link> had not been developed, there was no way to feed him (a fate resembling that of Gregor in the <i>Metamorphosis</i> and the main character of <i>A Hunger Artist</i>). His body was ultimately brought back to Prague where he was interred on <link label="June 11">June 11</link>, <link label="1924">1924</link>, in the New Jewish Cemetery (sector 21, row 14, plot 33) in <link label="Žižkov">Prague-Žižkov</link>.</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Personal views</title>
<p>Kafka maintained his indifference to formal religion throughout most of his life. Yet, while never depicting the characters in his stories as Jewish, he never tried to obfuscate his Jewish roots. Intellectually, <link label="Hasidism">Hasidism</link> held a strong appeal for him, especially because of the value it places in transcendent, <link label="Mysticism">mystical</link> experience. During the last ten years of his life, Kafka even professed an interest in moving to  <link label="Palestine">Palestine</link>. The ethical and procedural dilemmas presented in &quot;<link label="The Judgment">The Judgment</link>,&quot; &quot;<link label="The Stoker">The Stoker</link>,&quot; &quot;<link label="A Hunger Artist">A Hunger Artist</link>,&quot; and &quot;<link label="A Country Doctor">A Country Doctor</link>&quot; all bear distinct traces of Kafka's interest in rabbinical teachings as they pertain to law and justice. In addition, many of Kafka's short stories bear striking similarities to Jewish folk tales and parables (Before the Law, for example) The humorously meticulous style of the argumentative narrator in &quot;<link label="Josephine the Singer">Josephine the Singer</link>,&quot; on the other hand, shadows the rhetorical conventions of rabbinical discourse.<ref>Kafka (1996, xiv&amp;ndash;xv).</ref></p>
</section></section><section depth="1"><title>Literary work</title>
<p><img src="Grave of Kafka.JPG">thumb|260px|Franz Kafka's grave in Prague-Žižkov.</img> </p>

<p>Kafka published only a few short stories during his lifetime, a small part of his work, and never finished any of his novels (with the possible exception of <i><link label="The Metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</link></i>, which some consider to be a short novel). His writing attracted little attention until after his death. Prior to his death, he instructed his friend and <link label="Literary executor">literary executor</link> <link label="Max Brod">Max Brod</link> to destroy all of his manuscripts. His lover, Dora Diamant, partially executed his wishes, secretly keeping up to 20 notebooks and 35 letters until they were confiscated by the <link label="Gestapo">Gestapo</link> in 1933. An ongoing international search is being conducted for these missing Kafka papers. Brod overrode Kafka's instructions and instead oversaw the publication of most of the work in his possession, which soon began to attract attention and high critical regard.
 
All of Kafka's published works, except several letters he wrote in Czech to Milena Jesenská, were written in German.</p>
<section depth="2"><title>Style of writing</title>
<p>Kafka often made extensive use of a trait special to the German language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the period&amp;mdash;that being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is achieved due to the construction of certain sentences in German which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions cannot be duplicated in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same effect found in the original text.<ref>Kafka (1996, xi).</ref> One such instance of a Kafka translator's quandary is demonstrated in <link label="The Metamorphosis#Lost in translation">the first sentence of ''The Metamorphosis''</link>.</p>

<p>Another virtually insurmountable problem facing the translator is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous terms or of words that have several meanings. An example is Kafka's use of the <link label="German language">German</link> noun <i><link label="Wikt:Verkehr">Verkehr</link></i> in the final sentence of <i><link label="The Judgment">The Judgment</link></i>. The sentence can be translated as: &quot;<i>At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge.</i>&quot;<ref>Kafka (1996, 75).</ref> What gives added weight to the obvious double meaning of <i>Verkehr</i> is Kafka's confession to his friend and biographer <link label="Max Brod">Max Brod</link> that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of &quot;a violent ejaculation.&quot; In the English translation, of course, what can <i>Verkehr</i> be but &quot;traffic&quot;?<ref>Kafka (1996, xii).</ref></p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Critical interpretation</title>
<p><img src="Kafka monument.jpg">right|260px|thumb|Bronze statue of Franz Kafka in Prague.</img> </p>

<p>Many critics have tried to make sense of Kafka's works by interpreting them through certain schools of literary criticism such as <link label="Modernism">modernism</link>, <link label="Magical realism">magical realism</link>, and so on.&lt;ref name=interpretation&gt;<external href="http://www.coskunfineart.com/details.asp?workID=40">Franz Kafka 1883 – 1924</external> www.coskunfineart.com&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent hopelessness and the absurdity that seem to permeate his works are considered emblematic of <link label="Existentialism">existentialism</link>. Others have tried to locate a <link label="Marxism">Marxist</link> influence in his satirization of bureaucracy in pieces such as <i><link label="In the Penal Colony">In the Penal Colony</link></i>, <i><link label="The Trial">The Trial</link></i>, and <i><link label="The Castle (novel)">The Castle</link></i>,&lt;ref name=interpretation/&gt; whereas others point to <link label="Anarchism">anarchism</link> as an inspiration for Kafka's anti-bureaucratic viewpoint. Still others have interpreted his works through the lens of Judaism (<link label="Borges">Borges</link> made a few perceptive remarks in this regard), through <link label="Freud">Freud</link>ianism&lt;ref name=interpretation/&gt; (because of his familial struggles), or as allegories of a metaphysical quest for <link label="God">God</link> (<link label="Thomas Mann">Thomas Mann</link> was a proponent of this theory).</p>

<p>Themes of alienation and persecution are repeatedly emphasized, and the emphasis on this quality, notably in the work of <link label="Marthe Robert">Marthe Robert</link>, partly inspired the counter-criticism of <link label="Gilles Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</link> and <link label="Felix Guattari">Felix Guattari</link>, who argued that there was much more to Kafka than the stereotype of a lonely figure writing out of anguish, and that his work was more deliberate, subversive, and more &quot;joyful&quot; than it appears to be.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an isolated reading of Kafka's work — focusing on the futility of his characters' struggling without the influence of any studies on Kafka's life was worthless — reveals the humor of Kafka. Kafka's work, in this sense, is not a written reflection of any of his own struggles, but a reflection of how people invent struggles. </p>

<p>Biographers have said that it was common for Kafka to read chapters of the books he was working on to his closest friends, and that those readings usually concentrated on the humorous side of his prose. <link label="Milan Kundera">Milan Kundera</link> refers to the essentially surrealist humour of Kafka as a main predecessor of later artists such as <link label="Federico Fellini">Federico Fellini</link>, <link label="Gabriel García Márquez">Gabriel García Márquez</link>, <link label="Carlos Fuentes">Carlos Fuentes</link> and <link label="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</link>. For Márquez it was as he said the reading of Kafka's <i><link label="The Metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</link></i> that showed him &quot;that it was possible to write in a different way&quot;. &lt;!--This whole article, but particularly this section, needs sources--&gt;</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Publications and dates</title> 
<p>Readers of Kafka should pay particular attention to the dates of the publications (whether German or translated) of his writing when choosing an edition to read. </p>

<p>Kafka died before preparing (in some cases even finishing) some of his writings for publication. Therefore, the novels <i><link label="The Castle (novel)">The Castle</link></i> (which stopped mid-sentence and had ambiguity on content), <i><link label="The Trial">The Trial</link></i> (chapters were unnumbered and some were incomplete) and <i><link label="Amerika (Kafka novel)">Amerika</link></i> (Kafka's original title was <i>The Man who Disappeared</i>) were all prepared for publishing by <link label="Max Brod">Max Brod</link>. It appears Brod took a few liberties with the manuscript (moving chapters, changing the German and cleaning up the punctuation) and hence the original German text, that was not published, was altered. The editions by Brod are generally referred to as the Definitive Editions.</p>

<p>According to the publisher's note<ref><external href="http://www.jhom.com/bookshelf/kafka/intro.html">A Kafka For The 21st Century by Arthur Samuelson, publisher, Schocken Books</external> www.jhom.com</ref> for <i>The Castle</i> (<link label="Schocken Books">Schocken Books</link>, 1998), <link label="Malcolm Pasley">Malcolm Pasley</link> was able to get most of Kafka's original handwritten work into the <link label="University of Oxford">Oxford</link> <link label="Bodleian Library">Bodleian Library</link> in 1961. The text for <i><link label="The Trial">The Trial</link></i> was later acquired through auction and is stored at the German literary archives<ref><template head="de icon"></template> <external href="http://www.dla-marbach.de/">Herzlich Willkommen</external> www.dla-marbach.de </ref> at <link label="Marbach am Neckar">Marbach</link>, Germany (publisher's note, <i>The Trial</i>, Schocken Books, 1998).</p>

<p>Subsequently, <link label="Malcolm Pasley">Pasley</link> headed a team (including <link label="Gerhard Neumann">Gerhard Neumann</link>, <link label="Jost Schillemeit">Jost Schillemeit</link>, and <link label="Jürgen Born">Jürgen Born</link>) in reconstructing the German novels and <link label="S.

These are all called the 'Critical Editions' or the 'Fischer Editions'. The German critical text of these, and Kafka's other works, may be found online at <i>The Kafka Project</i>.<ref><external href="http://www.kafka.org/index.php?project">The Kafka Project - Kafka's Works in German According to the Manuscript</external> www.kafka.org</ref></p>

<p>There is another Kafka Project based at San Diego State University, which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka's last writings. Consisting of 20 notebooks and 35 letters to Kafka's last companion, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), this missing literary treasure was confiscated from her by the Gestapo in Berlin 1933. The Kafka Project's four-month search of government archives in Berlin in 1998 uncovered the confiscation order and other significant documents. In 2003, the Kafka Project discovered three original Kafka letters, written in 1923. Building on the search conducted by Max Brod and Klaus Wagenbach in the mid-1950s, the Kafka Project at SDSU has an advisory committee of international scholars and researchers, and is calling for volunteers who want to help solve a literary mystery.<ref>Sources: Kafka, by Nicolas Murray, pages 367, 374; Kafka's Last Love, by Kathi Diamant; &quot;Summary of the Results of the Kafka Project Berlin Research June 1-September 1998&quot; published in December 1998 Kafka Katern, quarterly of the Kafka Circle of the Netherlands.

</section><section depth="2"><title>Translations</title>
<p>There are two primary sources for the translations based on the two German editions. The earliest English translations were by <link label="Edwin Muir">Edwin</link> and Willa Muir and published by <link label="Alfred A. Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</link>. These editions were widely published and spurred the late-1940's surge in Kafka's popularity in the United States. Later editions (notably the 1954 editions) had the addition of the deleted text translated by <link label="Eithne Wilkins">Eithne Wilkins</link> and <link label="Ernst Kaiser">Ernst Kaiser</link>. These are known 'Definitive Editions'. They translated both <i><link label="The Trial, Definitive Edition, Muir Translation">The Trial, Definitive</link></i> and <i><link label="The Castle, Definitive Edition, Muir Translation">The Castle, Definitive</link></i> among other writings.
