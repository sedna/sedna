<p>Following the <link label="Soviet space program">Soviet space program</link>'s launch of the world's first human-made <link label="Satellite">satellite</link> (<i><link label="Sputnik 1">Sputnik 1</link></i>) on <link label="4 October">4 October</link>, <link label="1957">1957</link>, the attention of the <link label="United States">United States</link> turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The <link label="Congress of the United States">U.S. Congress</link>, alarmed by the perceived threat to U.S. security and technological leadership (known as the &quot;<i><link label="Sputnik crisis">Sputnik crisis</link></i>&quot;), urged immediate and swift action; President <link label="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</link> and his advisors counseled more deliberate measures. Several months of debate produced an agreement that a new federal agency was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space. <link label="DARPA">DARPA</link> was also created at this time and many of DARPA's early space programs were soon transferred to NASA.</p>

<p>Explorer-I, officially Satellite 1958 Alpha (and sometimes referred to as Explorer 1), was the first Earth satellite of the United States, having been launched at 10:48pm EST on <link label="31 January">31 January</link> <link label="1958">1958</link>. On <link label="29 July">29 July</link> <link label="1958">1958</link>, President <link label="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</link> signed the <link label="National Aeronautics and Space Act">National Aeronautics and Space Act</link>, establishing the <b>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</b> (<b>NASA</b>). When it began operations on <link label="1 October">1 October</link>, <link label="1958">1958</link>, NASA consisted mainly of the four laboratories and some 80 employees of the government's 46-year-old research agency, the <link label="National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</link> (NACA). A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the <i>Space race</i> was the technology from the <link label="V-2 rocket">German rocket program</link>, led by <link label="Wernher von Braun">Wernher von Braun</link>, who became a <link label="Naturalization">naturalized citizen</link> of the United States after <link label="World War II">World War II</link>. He is today regarded as the father of the United States space program. Elements of the <link label="Army Ballistic Missile Agency">Army Ballistic Missile Agency</link> (of which von Braun's team was a part) and the <link label="U.S. Naval Research Laboratory">Naval Research Laboratory</link> were incorporated into NASA. 	</p>

<p>NASA's earliest programs involved research into <link label="Human spaceflight">human spaceflight</link> and were conducted under the pressure of the competition between the USA and the <link label="USSR">USSR</link> (the <link label="Space Race">Space Race</link>) that existed during the <link label="Cold War">Cold War</link>. The <link label="Mercury program">Mercury program</link>, initiated in 1958, started NASA down the path of human space exploration with missions designed to discover simply if man could survive in <link label="Outer space">space</link>. Representatives from the U.S. Army (M.L. Raines, LTC, USA), Navy (P.L. Havenstein, CDR, USN) and Air Force (K.G. Lindell, COL, USAF) were selected/requested to provide assistance to the NASA Space Task Group through coordination with the existing U.S. military research and defense contracting infrastructure, and technical assistance resulting from experimental aircraft (and the associated military test pilot pool) development in the 1950s. On <link label="May 5">May 5</link>, <link label="1961">1961</link>, astronaut <link label="Alan B. Shepard Jr.">Alan B. Shepard Jr.</link> became the first American in space when he piloted <link label="Mercury-Redstone 3">''Freedom 7''</link> on a 15-minute suborbital flight. <link label="John Glenn">John Glenn</link> became the first American to orbit the Earth on <link label="20 February">20 February</link> <link label="1962">1962</link> during the 5 and a quarter-hour flight of <link label="Mercury-Atlas 6">''Friendship 7''</link>.</p>

<p>Once the Mercury project proved that human spaceflight was possible, <link label="Project Gemini">project Gemini</link> was launched to conduct experiments and work out issues relating to a moon mission. The first Gemini flight with astronauts on board, <link label="Gemini 3">Gemini III</link>, was flown by <link label="Virgil I. Grissom">Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom</link> and <link label="John W. Young">John W. Young</link> on <link label="23 March">23 March</link> <link label="1965">1965</link>. Nine other missions followed, showing that long-duration human space flight was possible, proving that rendezvous and docking with another vehicle in space was possible, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on human beings.</p>

<p>Skylab was the first <link label="Space station">space station</link> the <link label="United States">United States</link> launched into orbit. The 75 <link label="Tonne">metric tonne</link> station was in Earth orbit from 1973 to 1979, and was visited by crews three times, in 1973 and 1974. Skylab was originally intended to study gravitational anomalies in other solar systems, but the assignment was curtailed due to lack of funding and interest.  It included a laboratory for studying the effects of <link label="Microgravity">microgravity</link>, and a <link label="Apollo Telescope Mount">solar observatory</link>. A Space Shuttle was planned to dock with and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but Skylab reentered the atmosphere and was destroyed in 1979, before the first shuttle could be launched.</p>
</section><section depth="2"><title>Shuttle era</title>
<template head="main"><link label="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</link></template>
<p><img src="Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg">thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia</img>, <link label="April 12">April 12</link> <link label="1981">1981</link>.]]</p>

<p>The <link label="Space shuttle">space shuttle</link> became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned to be a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttles were built by 1985. The first to launch, <link label="Space Shuttle Columbia">''Columbia''</link>, did so on <link label="April 12">April 12</link>, <link label="1981">1981</link>.<ref>Bernier, Serge (Stephen Lyle Translator) <i>Space Odyssey: The First Forty Years of Space Exploration</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2002) ISBN 0-521-81356-5 </ref></p>

<p>The shuttle was not all good news for NASA — flights were much more expensive than initially projected, and even after the 1986 <link label="STS-51-L">''Challenger'' disaster</link> highlighted the risks of space flight, the public again lost interest as missions appeared to become mundane. Work began on <link label="Space Station Freedom">Space Station Freedom</link> as a focus for the manned space program but within NASA there was argument that these projects came at the expense of more inspiring unmanned missions such as the <link label="Voyager program">Voyager</link> probes. The <i>Challenger</i> disaster, aside from the late 1980s, marked a low point for NASA.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the shuttle has been used to launch milestone projects like the <link label="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</link> (HST). The HST was created with a relatively small budget of $2 billion but has continued operation since 1990 and has delighted both scientists and the public. Some of the images it has returned have become near-legendary, such as the groundbreaking <link label="Hubble Deep Field">Hubble Deep Field</link> images. The HST is a joint project between the <link label="European Space Agency">European Space Agency</link> (ESA) and NASA, and its success has paved the way for greater collaboration between the agencies.</p>

<p>In 1995 Russian-American interaction would again be achieved as the <link label="Shuttle-Mir Program">Shuttle-Mir</link> missions began, and once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft (this time a full-fledged space station). This cooperation continues to the present day, with Russia and America the two biggest partners in the largest space station ever built &amp;ndash; the <link label="International Space Station">International Space Station</link> (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS following the 2003 <link label="Space Shuttle Columbia disaster">''Columbia'' disaster</link>, which grounded the shuttle fleet for well over two years.</p>

<p>Costing over one hundred billion dollars, it has been difficult at times for NASA to justify the ISS. The <link label="Population">population</link> at large has historically been hard to impress with details of scientific experiments in space, preferring news of grand projects to exotic locations. Even now, the ISS cannot accommodate as many scientists as planned.</p>

<p>During much of the 1990s, NASA was faced with shrinking annual budgets due to Congressional belt-tightening in Washington, DC. In response, NASA's ninth administrator, <link label="Daniel S. Goldin">Daniel S. Goldin</link>, pioneered the &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; approach that enabled NASA to cut costs while still delivering a wide variety of aerospace programs (<link label="Discovery Program">Discovery Program</link>). That method was criticized and re-evaluated following the twin losses of <link label="Mars Climate Orbiter">Mars Climate Orbiter</link> and <link label="Mars Polar Lander">Mars Polar Lander</link> in 1999.  Yet, NASA's shuttle program had made 116 successful launches as of December 2006.</p>

<p>The Space Shuttle <i>Columbia</i> disaster in 2003, which killed the crew of six Americans and one Israeli, caused a 29-month hiatus in space shuttle flights and triggered a serious re-examination of NASA's priorities. The U.S. government, various scientists, and the public all reconsidered the future of the space program.</p>

<p>Built entirely by the <link label="Jet Propulsion Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</link> (JPL) in Pasadena, CA, NASA probes have been continually performing science at Mars since 1997, with at least two orbiters since 2001 and several <link label="Mars rover">Mars rover</link>s. The orbiting <link label="Mars Odyssey">Mars Odyssey</link> and <link label="Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</link> will continue monitoring the geology and climate of the Red Planet, as well as searching for evidence of past or present water and life, as they have since 2001 and 2006, respectively. If the <link label="Mars Global Surveyor">Mars Global Surveyor</link> spacecraft's nine-year lifetime is typical, these probes will continue to advance our knowledge for years to come. The <link label="Mars Exploration Rover Mission">Mars Exploration Rovers</link> <link label="Spirit rover">Spirit</link> and <link label="Opportunity rover">Opportunity</link> have been traversing the surface of Mars at <link label="Gusev Crater">Gusev Crater</link> and <link label="Meridiani Planum">Meridiani Planum</link> since early 2004, and will continue to image and investigate those environments. They have both already operated over ten times longer than expected, and remain a promising part of NASA's future.</p>

<p>With the creation of NASA in 1958, the NACA was abolished, and its research centers-- Ames Research Center, Lewis Research Center, and Langley Aeronautical Laboratory--were incorporated within the new space and aeronautics agency along with some elements of the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. In 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an <link label="Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel">Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel</link> (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In addition, there were the <link label="Space Program Advisory Council">Space Program Advisory Council</link> and the <link label="Research and Technology Advisory Council">Research and Technology Advisory Council</link>. </p>

<p>Currently, the <link label="International Space Station">ISS</link> relies on the Shuttle fleet for all major construction shipments.
The Shuttle fleet has lost two spacecraft and fourteen astronauts in two disasters in 1986 and 2003. While the <link label="Space Shuttle Challenger disaster">1986 loss</link> was mitigated by building <link label="Space Shuttle Endeavour">Shuttle ''Endeavour''</link> from replacement parts, NASA does not plan to build another shuttle to replace the <link label="STS-107">second loss</link>. (See also <link label="Crew Exploration Vehicle">CEV</link>.)</p>

<p>The ISS, which was intended to have a crew of seven, just <link label="As of 2006">as of 2006</link> has been restored to a crew of three for the first time since it was cut to a skeleton crew of two in May 2003, causing many intended research projects to be delayed.  Since the <link label="Columbia Shuttle accident">Columbia Shuttle accident</link>, the permanent space station crew has comprised one Russian and one American, on board for six months at a time, meaning European and Japanese astronauts could not stay for longer missions. An increase in the number of crew members has been in the pipeline for some time but was delayed following the Columbia disaster in February 2003. </p>
