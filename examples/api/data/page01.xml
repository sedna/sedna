<p>Modern anarchism, however, sprung from the secular thought of the <link label="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</link>, particularly <link label="Rousseau">Rousseau</link>'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, <i><link label="Encarta">Encarta</link> Online Encyclopedia</i> 2006 (UK version)&lt;/ref&gt; Although by the turn of the 19th century the term &quot;anarchist&quot; had an entirely positive connotation, it first entered the English language in 1642 during the <link label="English Civil War">English Civil War</link> as a term of <link label="Abuse">abuse</link> used by <link label="Cavalier">Royalists</link> to damn those who were fermenting disorder.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the <link label="French Revolution">French Revolution</link> some, such as the <i>Enragés,</i><template head="huh"></template> began to use the term positively,<ref>Sheehan, Sean. <i>Anarchism</i>, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. pg. 85</ref> in opposition to <link label="Jacobin (politics)">Jacobin</link> centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as <link label="Oxymoron">oxymoron</link>ic.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; From this climate <link label="William Godwin">William Godwin</link> developed what many consider the first expression of <link label="Anarchist schools of thought">modern anarchist thought</link>.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;/&gt; Godwin was, according to <link label="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</link>, &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;<ref>Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to <link label="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</link>'s <i><external href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Burke0061/Vindication/0339_Bk.html">Vindication of Natural Society</external></i>. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's <i>Vindication of Natural Society</i>; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…&quot; - footnote, Ch. 2 <i>Political Justice</i> by William Godwin.</ref> Godwin, a <link label="Philosophical anarchist">philosophical anarchist</link>, opposed revolutionary action and saw a <link label="Minarchy">minimal state</link> as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot;<ref>Godwin said: &quot;…however we may be obliged to admit it as a necessary evil for the present, it behoves us, as the friends of reason and the human species, to admit as little of it as possible, and carefully to observe whether, in consequence of the gradual illumination of the human mind, that little may not hereafter be diminished.&quot; <external href="http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pj51.html">&quot;An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot;</external></ref> that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;<template head="sep entry"><field>godwin</field><field>William Godwin</field></template>&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin advocated extreme <link label="Individualism">individualism</link>, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.<ref>&quot;everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.&quot; – In <i>Britannica Concise Encyclopedia</i>.

<p>The first to describe himself as anarchist was <link label="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</link>,&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;<external href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml">&quot;Anarchism&quot;</external>, <link label="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</link> program, <link label="In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)">In Our Time</link>, Thursday <link label="December 7">December 7</link> <link label="2006">2006</link>.

H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p.45. </ref> and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;<ref>Proudon, Pierre-Joseph. The Federal Principle. &quot;The notion of <i>anarchy</i> in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;</ref> Like Godwin, Proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action. He saw anarchy as &quot;a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune.&quot;<ref><i>Selected Writings</i>, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</ref></p></section><section depth="1"><title>Schools of thought</title>

Mutualism began in 19th century English and French labor movements, then took an anarchist form associated with <link label="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</link> in France and others in the US.<ref>&quot;A member of a community,&quot; <i>The Mutualist</i>; this 1826 series criticized <link label="Robert Owen">Robert Owen</link>'s proposals, and has been attributed to Josiah Warren or another dissident Owenite in the same circles; Wilbur, Shawn, 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;</ref> This influenced individualist anarchists in the United States such as <link label="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</link> and <link label="William B.

Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Tucker.<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot;On Picket Duty&quot;, <i>Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881-1908)</i>; <link label="5 January">5 January</link> <link label="1889">1889</link>; 6, 10; APS Online pg. 1</ref></p>

<p>Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. Many mutualists<template head="who?"></template> believe a market without government intervention drives prices to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent, and interest according to the <link label="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</link>. Firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, raising wages.<ref>&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, <i>Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments</i>. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875)|<link label="William Batchelder Greene">William Batchelder Greene</link>: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;</ref></p>

<p>Some see mutualism as an ideology falling between individualist and collectivist anarchism.<ref>Avrich, Paul. <i>Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America</i>, Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-691-04494-5, p.6&lt;br/&gt;Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p.11</ref> In <i>What Is Property?</i>, Proudhon develops a concept of &quot;liberty&quot;, equivalent to &quot;anarchy&quot;, which is the dialectical &quot;synthesis of communism and property.&quot;<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph <external href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/ProProp.html">''What is Property?''</external> (1840), p. 281</ref> Greene, influenced by <link label="Pierre Leroux">Pierre Leroux</link>, sought mutualism in the synthesis of three philosophies — communism, capitalism and socialism.<ref>Greene, William B. &quot;Communism — Capitalism — Socialism&quot;, <i>Equality</i> (1849)<external href="http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/greene/wbg-css.html">http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/greene/wbg-css.html</external>, p. 59. </ref> Later individualist anarchists used the term mutualism but retained little emphasis on synthesis, while <link label="Social anarchism">social anarchists</link> such as the authors of <link label="An Anarchist FAQ">An Anarchist FAQ</link> claim mutualism as a subset of their philosophical tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;/&gt;</p>

&quot;Anarchism does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force.

In the early twentieth century anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism. With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits radical <link label="Trade union">trade union</link>s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically <link label="Workers' self-management">self-managed by the workers</link>. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions.

<p>Anarcho-syndicalism and other branches of anarchism are not mutually exclusive: anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution.

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;<ref> Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in <i>Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas</i>, Vol. 1, p.100 <external href="http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm">http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm</external></ref> In 1907, the <link label="International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam">International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</link> gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the <link label="Anarchist movement">anarchist movement</link>, including <link label="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</link>, <link label="Pierre Monatte">Pierre Monatte</link>, <link label="Luigi Fabbri">Luigi Fabbri</link>, <link label="Benoît Broutchoux">Benoît Broutchoux</link>, <link label="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</link>, <link label="Rudolf Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</link>, <link label="Christiaan Cornelissen">Christiaan Cornelissen</link>, etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <link label="Popular education">popular education</link> issues, the <link label="General strike">general strike</link> or <link label="Anti-militarism">anti-militarism</link>. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and <link label="Syndicalism">syndicalism</link> (or <link label="Trade-union">trade-union</link>ism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social <link label="Revolution">revolution</link>, while Malatesta considered that syndicalism by itself was not sufficient.<ref><external href="http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225">Extract of Malatesta's declaration</external> <template head="fr icon"></template></ref> Malatesta thought that trade-unions were <link label="Reformist">reformist</link>, and could even be, at times, <link label="Conservative">conservative</link>. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example <link label="Labor unions in the United States">US trade-unions</link>, where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.</p>

<p>The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the <link label="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</link> (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the <link label="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</link>. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.

Anarchists participated alongside the <link label="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</link> in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 <link label="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</link>. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the <link label="Free Territory (Ukraine)">Ukraine</link>, anarchists fought in the <link label="Russian Civil War">civil war</link> against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the <link label="Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine">Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</link> led by <link label="Nestor Makhno">Nestor Makhno</link>, who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.</p>

<p>Expelled American anarchists <link label="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</link> and <link label="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</link> were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.

For them, <link label="Bakunin">Bakunin</link>'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;You can see quite well that behind all the democratic and socialistic phrases and promises in Marx’s program for the State lies all that constitutes the true despotic and brutal nature of all states, regardless of their form of government.&quot; Bakunin, Mikhail (1872) &quot;<external href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm">On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx</external>&quot; in <i>Bakunin on Anarchy</i>, translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; had proved all too true.</p>

<p>The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; <link label="Communist party">Communist parties</link> grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.

<p>In Paris, the <link label="Dielo Truda">Dielo Truda</link> group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included <link label="Nestor Makhno">Nestor Makhno</link>, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of <link label="Fascism">fascism</link> in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.

<p>In Spain, the <link label="CNT">CNT</link> initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory.

Anarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse and heterogeneous attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of <link label="Anarchism and capitalism">capitalism</link> (which anarchists usually reject, according to the <i><link label="Oxford Companion to Philosophy">Oxford Companion to Philosophy</link></i>&lt;ref name=oxcom/&gt;), <link label="Anarchism and nationalism">nationalism</link> and <link label="Anarchism and religion">religion</link> with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as <link label="Anarchism and Marxism">Marxism</link>, <link label="Issues in anarchism#Communism">communism</link> and <link label="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</link>. Anarchists may be motivated by <link label="Humanism">humanism</link>, <link label="Christian anarchism">divine authority</link>, <link label="Ethical egoism">enlightened self-interest</link> or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.</p>

<p>Phenomena such as <link label="Civilization">civilization</link>, <link label="Technology">technology</link> (e.g. within <link label="Primitivism">primitivism</link> and <link label="Insurrectionary anarchism">insurrectionary anarchism</link>), and <link label="Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy">the democratic process</link> may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards <link label="Issues in anarchism#Race">race</link>, <link label="Issues in anarchism#Gender">gender</link> and <link label="Issues in anarchism#The environment">the environment</link> have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>On a tactical level, while <link label="Propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</link> was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the <link label="Nihilist movement">Nihilist movement</link>), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as <link label="Nonviolence">nonviolence</link>, <link label="Counter-economics">counter-economics</link> and <link label="Crypto-anarchism">anti-state cryptography</link> to bring about an anarchist society.
