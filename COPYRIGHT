   SOFTWARE RIGHTS
  
   We reserve no LEGAL rights to the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool
   Set (PCCTS) -- PCCTS is in the public domain.  An individual or
   company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with
   PCCTS or the code generated by PCCTS, including the incorporation of
   PCCTS, or its output, into commercial software.
  
   We encourage users to develop software with PCCTS.  However, we do ask
   that credit is given to us for developing PCCTS.  By "credit",
   we mean that if you incorporate our source code into one of your
   programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
   acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
   etc...  If you like PCCTS and have developed a nice tool with the
   output, please mention that you developed it using PCCTS.  In
   addition, we ask that this header remain intact in our source code.
   As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing
   this system and expect to make other tools available as they are
   completed.
